Board Bill No. 31
(Committee Substitute)

An ordinance submitting to the qualified
voters of the city of St. Louis a proposed
amendment to the charter of the city of St.
Louis restructuring the board of aldermen as a
body of twelve (12) aldermen representing
twelve (12) wards, providing a transition
schedule for such changes, and other related
matters; providing for an election to be held
for voting on the proposed amendment and
for the manner of voting; and for the
publication, certification, deposit, and
recording of this ordinance; and containing an
emergency clause.

Explanation of Vote on Board Bill 31 in
Accordance with Rule 47 of the Board of
Aldermen

I am voting in favor of Board Bill 31,
because I fundamentally believe that our
voters have the right to determine how much
representation they want. Board Bill 31
enables voters to decide whether they wish to
change the Charter to reduce the number of
aldermen from 28 to 14. However, although
Charter changes require 60% of all voters to
vote in the affirmative, even the vote does not
allow voters in each ward to make this
determination. So, for example, if voters in
one ward are extremely upset with their
aldermanic representation, they might weight
the vote heavily in favor of reducing the Board
of Aldermen. And, if voters in one ward are
extremely happy with their aldermanic
representation, they might weight the vote
heavily in opposition to reducing the Board
of Aldermen.

The process is being promoted by the
sponsors as largely symbolic for the following
reasons:

1. there has been no study of the impact
of this reduction on representation, service
delivery, or operations of the City.

2. minimal savings, if any, are
anticipated.

3. there has been no consideration of
alternative scenarios such as reducing or
increasing the Board of Aldermen gradually,
tied to specific population changes over time
at redistricting, following a Census.

In 2004 when the Charter Amendments
were proposed, including one to reduce the
number of aldermen, I noted that there isn’t
any “magical” number appropriate for the
number of aldermen we should have. At that
time it was suggested that the values for
discussion were greater efficiency, greater
effectiveness, increased equity, greater
accountability, and greater responsiveness.
Greater Efficiency: The less diversity and
fewer people you have in any body, the more
likely it is that there will be less discussion
and fewer disagreements. This could be
viewed as greater efficiency. However, it is
also less democratic.
Greater Effectiveness: This is a value
judgment, depending on who happens to be
the alderman you have and whom you have
eliminated from the Board of Aldermen as a
result of having fewer aldermen. Fewer
members of the Board of Aldermen does not
necessarily mean that you will have more
qualified members to make decisions and to
represent their constituencies. This is also a
value judgment depending upon what the
Board of Aldermen is expected to do. To
exaggerate the point for illustration purposes,
the most effective and efficient Board of
Aldermen would likely be one consisting of
one member, who would make all decisions.
However, if we are asking aldermen to “roll
up their sleeves” and advocate for service
delivery to meet the challenges of their
respective wards, then fewer advocates might
not mean greater effectiveness.
Increased Equity: I fail to see how fewer
members of the Board of Aldermen would
increase equitable distribution of resources and
services. In fact, in 2012 I am recognizing
this as a social justice issue. If we know:
1) that the number and severity of
challenges are increasing in our City, 2)
that our City has aging infrastructure that
is demanding more and more resources,
3) that we have more service needs with
fewer persons to perform services, and 4)
we have not made systemic changes to
deliver services more efficiently and
effectively, then reducing the Board of
Aldermen would result in less help being
offered to those who are in greater need.
Greater Accountability: This depends upon
to whom one wishes the individual members
of the Board of Aldermen to be accountable.
It is my belief that the fewer constituents one
has, the more accountable he/she is to those
constituents and the less likely that outside
influences, including lobbyists and money, can
work to try to dilute the influence of “real
people”.

Greater Responsiveness: It is unlikely that
fewer aldermen would result in greater
responsiveness. Certainly, additional
constituency outreach would allow for
telephone calls, e-mails, social networks, and
other means of communication to occur with
constituents. However, the personal touch
of speaking one-on-one between elected
officials and constituents could be diminished.
As we know, the more people through which
a message goes, the more likely that message
is to be changed by the perspective of the
individual passing the message along. And,
the more likely that the message will be
misinterpreted. Since at least 1876 there have
been 28 wards.

I believe we are putting the cart before
the horse, because we have not identified:

1. the functions aldermen are currently
performing;

2. the amount of time spent on each of
these functions and the percentage of time
devoted to each function;

3. what functions we want aldermen to
be performing and who (or what) should be
performing functions if aldermen are no longer
going to be performing them; and

4. what amount of aldermanic time is
devoted to service delivery versus legislative
policy-making, for instance, and how we might
increase service delivery efficiency and
effectiveness to reduce the amount of
aldermanic time devoted to this function.

It seems as though some in the
community have seized upon what appear to
be mathematical formulas to set a new number
of wards. Namely numbers have been bantered
about like the high watermark of 800,000
residents in the City of St. Louis that existed
in the 1950s. Some have then hypothesized
that the mathematical formula would then be
that we should cut the membership in the
Board of Aldermen in half. While there might
be some arguments to consider cutting the
Board of Aldermen by 50%, particularly if
we achieved efficiencies and effectiveness in
government through reform of the service
delivery systems, nevertheless the 800,000
number seems to be an irrelevant number.
What does seem significant to me are the
census figures for 1870 (the last census prior
to the Charter of 1876 which preceded the
current 1914 Charter). If St. Louisans were
calculating representation ratios for legislators
in 1876 based on population, then these are
the figures they had. Also potentially relevant
would be the 1880 census figures for the City
of St. Louis, following the schism of the City
and County in 1876 and the resulting Charter

of 1876. Also relevant would be the 1910 cens
results for the City of St. Louis in 2000 and 20
