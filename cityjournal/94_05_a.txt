WHEREAS, Minnie and Joe Anderson

loves to this day.) Minnie developed a love

daughters were born, Dawn Anderson
(Hampton) and Carmen Anderson (Buckner);
and

later accepted a job at Sheraton Reservations
(where she was the top sales agent and awarded
several trips.) She later took an interest in
health insurance and worked several years at
Blue Cross/Blue Shield. So, where is she
currently working right now? Minnie would
probably tell you, “I’m not sure what I want
to do next. I’ll never officially be retired. I’m
just taking a break”; and

WHEREAS, Joe Anderson retired from
Pevely Dairy Mile Company in 1999, after
over 30 years of hard labor and sacrifice! He
enjoys his retirement and loves the idea of
never having to punch anyone’s time clock
again…; and

the Florissant area. Minnie is a dedicated
member of Christ Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church

down on her with that special smile that only
the two of them can share; and

WHEREAS, Joe Anderson is known by
many as the sharpest dressed and St. Louis
best. He’s often labeled to be very slow…but
that’s okay because he steals the show. Joe is
also an excellent handyman! If it breaks, he
can fix it. If it’s in the way, he can move it. If
it’s lost, he can find it. And if they don’t sell
it anymore, he can make one.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 50th wedding
anniversary of Minnie and Joe Anderson and

Resolution No. 328
Pastor Robert Franklin
WHEREAS, Pastor Robert Maurice
Franklin, Sr. was born on March 28, 1933 in
Laing, West Virginia. He was the 7th child of
12 children born to James McKinley, a coal
miner, and Mabel Pearl (McFadden) Franklin,
who passed away during childbirth. With
seven brothers, four sisters, and six close
cousins, the Franklin family was a force to
reckon with. With limited job opportunities
in his hometown and not wanting to work the
coal mines, Pastor Franklin followed in his
older brothers footsteps, whom had served in
World War II, and entered the United States
Army in 1953. After receiving an honorable
discharge in 1955, he continued to serve his
country for six additional years in the Army
Reserve; and
WHEREAS, after leaving the Army,
Pastor Franklin moved to Chicago to live with
his sister, Elizabeth, and work for U.S. Steel
Company. In March 1956, he met the love of
his life, Dixie Louise Turner. Less than one
year later they were married on January 7,
1957. During the first two years of their
marriage, their first set of children was born,
Robert Jr., in 1957 and Angelia, in 1958; and
WHEREAS, in 1960, Pastor Franklin
moved to St. Louis, where he gained

employment with the National Lead Company
(now Rheox). Pastor Franklin served in several
capacities within the Oil and Atomic Workers
Union Local 5-152 and was also a member of
the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists. He
finally retired from Rheox in 1996 after 34
years of service, giving him more time to devote
to his other full time job as Pastor of Greater
Fellowship Baptist Church; and
WHEREAS, baptized as a child, Pastor
Franklin received Christ at an early age at the
First Baptist Church of Laing West, Virginia.
After arriving in St. Louis, Pastor Franklin
joined fellowship with the New Emanuel
Baptist Church. With the encouragement of
his mother-in-law and father-in-law, Pastor
Franklin became very active at New Emanuel.
He served as an Usher, Adult Sunday School
teacher, Financial Secretary, Deacon and
eventually became an Ordained Minister. The
Lord then challenged Pastor Franklin to a
higher calling as Senior Pastor of Musik Baptist
Church, where he served for four years. He
then went on to serve as Founder and Senior
Pastor of the Greater Fellowship Baptist
Church for 35 years. It was during this time in
Pastor Franklin’s life that God blessed him
with two more children, Cecil “Ken”, in 1976
and Micah, in 1978; and
WHEREAS, Pastor Franklin displayed
his devotion through his leadership as
Chaplain of the Missouri Baptist Children’s
Home, President of the Rainbow Coalition ,
St. Louis Chapter, the Missouri President of
the African American Fellowship of Southern
Baptists and as a dedicated board member of
the Clergy Coalition of Metropolitan St.
Louis. Pastor Franklin also participated in The
St. Louis NAACP, Progressive Baptists,
National Baptists, The St. Louis Ministers’
Union, the Metropolitan Ministerial Alliance,
Southern Baptists, Metropolitan Ministers’
Alliance and the Gospel Men’s Fellowship;
and
WHEREAS, second only to God, family
was the most important thing to Pastor
Franklin. He was a devoted husband to Dixie
Franklin for 54 years up until the time of his
death. Pastor Franklin has been instrumental
as a father to his four children and their
spouses, as well as the Greater Fellowship
young people who became his surrogate
children, and his nieces and nephews who saw
him as a positive role model. He loved all of
his grandchildren, who called him Pawpaw,
often spoiling them with candy and other
treats. He was so proud of all of them and
would brag about them any chance he got; and
WHEREAS, Pastor Franklin was
preceded in death by two brothers, Thomas
D. (Lena) Franklin and David M. (Maxine)

Franklin; and one sister, Sylvia (William)
Harris. He leaves to cherish his loving memory:
his wife, Dixie; three sons, Robert (Anna)
Franklin, Jr., Cecil (Tiffany) Franklin, and
Micah Franklin; one daughter, Angelia (Larry)
Davis; eleven grandchildren, Robyn, Larry Jr.,
Kimberly, Jordan, Robert III, Alexus, Micah
Jr., Mayah, Mekhi, Elizabeth, and Joshua. He
leaves his legacy of love to his five brothers,
Cecil (Vivian) Franklin of Cincinnati, OH,
William (Betty) Franklin of Warren, OH,
Gordon D. (Susie) Franklin of Warren, OH,
Donald (Donna) Franklin of Chicago, IL, and
Marvin (Thelma) Franklin of Victorville, CA;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT

Resolution No. 329

Mildred G. Carbin
WHEREAS, St. Louis native, Mildred
G. Carbin, was born February 25, 1941 to
Lila and Walter Johnson, the eldest of seven
children. Mildred attended the historically
acclaimed Sumner High School and graduated
with the class of 1959. As a child, she grew up
in the infamous Ville neighborhood, just blocks
west of St. Louis’ famous Gaslight Square;
and

WHEREAS, Mildred was always busy
making things happen either at home or at
work. In fact, at age 12, she took her first job
at the local neighborhood grocery store. During
the 1960’s, Mildred found love with former
husbands, Freddie Bland and Harold Hulsey.
That love created Mildred’s masterpiece, her
two sons, Roderick (Roddy) and Harold
(Pepe); and
WHEREAS, as a mother, Mildred knew
that she had to provide for her sons. As a
powerful and committed mother, she began
her professional career as a sheet metal worker
at the McDonnell Douglas Company. Not
many African Americans or women were
allowed to reach this level of employment.
As a trail blazer, Mildred busted “the glass
ceiling” for over thirty years. During her tenure,
she went back to college earned her degree in
business with honors and was promoted to
supervisor; and
WHEREAS, Mildred is best described
as a mountain; unmoved yet moving,
constantly changing yet always appearing the
same- she is magnificent. It is that
mountainous character that has given her the
strength to survive breast cancer twice,
succeed as a loving single mother, and
overcome countless other life challenges with
ease; and
WHEREAS, to Mildred, the day is
never done. There is always work to do and
work she has done. As a founding member of
the 1959 Sumner Alumni Club, she help build
one of the city’s largest and longest standing
scholarship organizations in St. Louis. For
over thirty years, Mildred and her classmates
have organized the “Oldies but Goodies
Dance,” hosting thousands of supporters each
year and raising thousands of scholarship
dollars to support local students entering
college; and
WHEREAS, as we celebrate Mildred’s
many accomplishments throughout her
magnificent 70 years, the most notable of those

would be her dedication and devotion to her
family. Mildred has invested most her life to
her children and five grandchildren. They are
her heart, our blessing and hope that the legacy
of Mildred Carbin lives forever.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

Resolution No. 343
Mary Hayes
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Mary Hayes will be receiving an award for
from Grace Hill and her name will be placed
on the Hall of Fame of the Grace Hill Women’s
Business Center; and
WHEREAS, Mary Hayes developed a
love of cooking when she was very young and
living in the Pruitt-Igoe Housing Project. She
was not allowed to go outside while her
mother was at work so she experimented in
the kitchen. She read recipes and baked cookies
and cakes while she waited indoors. Because
she was afraid her mother might not be happy
about her helping herself to the ingredients,

she gave all the evidence away to the
neighborhood kids; and

WHEREAS, Mary still loves cooking.
“When I went to work for an engineering firm,
I got in the habit of doing a new recipe every
week for them to try and let me know whether
or not they liked it.” She worked with this
firm for 13 years and used her passion for
cooking as a creative outlet. “They seemed to
like everything, and it was therapy for me,”
she said; and

WHEREAS, Mary’s business began
simply by helping out the staff at the
engineering firm. They would ask her to
prepare one of her dishes for their special
occasions. Although she had been ‘testing’
her recipes, Mary wanted to do this right so
she went to the library and found books on
the catering business. This research on catering
lead her to the Grace Hill Women’s Business
Center to learn business skills; and

WHEREAS, later Mary began managing
events for the Urban League and started
catering on the side. She gradually bought
basic equipment and saving for larger catering
items. Then, two-and-a-half years ago when
she retired, Mary took the business
development classes at the Women’s Business
Center again and went into her own business;
and

WHEREAS, “My cooking was great,
but I needed instruction on pricing, taxes,
regulations and things like that,” she said. By
planning her purchases and saving for the major
equipment, she has managed to start her
business without a loan. In the beginning, a
client loaned her the use of a kitchen, but now
she has rented her own building for the
business. Mary recommends that anyone
considering starting a business should do their
homework and know all they can about the
business. Although her top suggestion for
entrepreneurs is to, “do what you love. Then
you will be happy in your work and that is
most important.”

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Mary Hayes for
her outstanding achievement and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our honoree at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

from Grace Hill and her name will be placed
on the Hall of Fame of the Grace Hill Women’s
Business Center; and

WHEREAS, Tameka Stigers has always

Missouri State, she went to St. Louis
University for the Masters of Public Health
program; and

WHEREAS, after graduating in 2008,
Tameka taught at Harris Stowe State
University and trained in the Sisterlocks
trademark hair care system. After juggling
both roles, she decided to open a salon in her
home and focus solely on the hair care business;
and

WHEREAS, Tameka’s business, Locs
of Glory, has a specialized niche in the hair
care market using the Sisterlocks system.
Sisterlocks is a way of styling natural hair and
does not use chemicals to create the small,
uniform locks. “With the system you can
wash your hair and go, never using a brush or
comb on it. There are no chemicals used and
you can style it however you want,’” Tameka
said; and

WHEREAS, While Tameka was teaching
public health at Harris Stowe State
University, she learned about the Grace Hill
Women’s Business Center. Her desire was to
make the business more professional so she
used the counseling services to develop a
business plan. In addition to the mentoring
through the Center, Tameka was connected
with resources at U.S. Bank to discuss loan
options. She was able to continue the success
of her business without this funding; and
WHEREAS, Tameka has developed
Locs of Glory into a family business. One
sister is also trained in the Sisterlocks system
and is currently taking classes in cosmetology
which could further the business. Another
sister helps with record keeping. She is raising
three of her high-school-age-siblings.

in 2004 and married her childhood sweetheart;
and
WHEREAS, one year for her mother’s
birthday, Angela created a book documenting
her life through words and pictures. As the
youngest of a very large family, her business
began as other relatives approached her to do
books. “Taking people through their life’s
sentimental journeys is a good way to describe
what my reality books are,” says Angela; and
WHEREAS, education has also been a
strong force for her. After graduating in the
first class from the High School of Performing
Arts, Angela attended Florissant Valley
Community College. She was not able to
graduate at that time, but continues to take
classes to continue her education; and
WHEREAS, With a growing business
and interest in continuing education, Angela
found the Grace Hill Women’s Business
Center. “I took the Business Development
Class to help me develop a real business plan.
I got a scholarship from the Grace Hill
Women’s Business Center and the class really
opened my eyes as to how to get started in a
business,.” She said. For instance she
discovered that she had been “working for
ink” when she learned about pricing her work;
and
WHEREAS, Angela continues to grow
her business and use the resources of the Grace
Hill Women’s Business Center. She has been
especially impressed by the SBA resources
available to her as a small business owner.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
