President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 68 - 71, 73 - 75 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 68
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
the first eighth grade class of The Big Picture
Middle School will soon be graduating; and
WHEREAS, Dennis Littky and Elliot
Washor founded The Big Picture Company
after receiving national attention for the success
of The Met High School, which they founded
in Providence, Rhode Island in 1996 after years
of agonizing over the best way to repair the
broken schools/school districts of Providence,
Rhode Island; and
WHEREAS, the excitement over Big
Picture Schools is the proven success of the
nontraditional approach that is embedded in
the culture/principles of the school that has
substantially improved achievement among
minority students of large economically
depressed urban school districts and
neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, some features of The Big
Picture include that classrooms are called
advisory and teachers are called advisors
instead of teachers. They are to act like
advisors rather than teachers, subsequently
learning is student centered. Advisors are there
to assist, to point, to help problem solve, to
provide resources, but not to take charge of
student learning that is led by the student;
and
WHEREAS, after the school was closed
down, Alderman Samuel L. Moore
successfully petitioned the St. Louis Board
of Education to open the school for the use of
The Big Picture School. Alderman Moore was
instrumental in the start of this school; and
WHEREAS, the St. Louis Public Schools
opened three Big Picture Schools at the

beginning of the 2007-2008 school year. There
is an elementary, middle and high school.
Although the Big Picture model is new to the
St. Louis Public Schools, within the district
all three schools are housed in preexisting
district buildings; and

WHEREAS, Big Picture Middle School
opened in the Ville on August 20, 2007 with
65 students; and

WHEREAS, Big Picture Middle School
has a small student teacher ratio of 16:1 and
students at Big Picture Middle have done a
number of service learning projects in the Ville
and have partnered with Homer G. Senior
Citizens Home; and

WHEREAS, the first eighth grade class
has now completed four rigorous exhibitions;
and

WHEREAS, this is the first graduation
class and we would like to congratulate and
recognize Principal Sean Nichols for his
dedication in The Big Picture School.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the first graduating
class of The Big Picture Middle School and
we wish the class continued success and
achievement in all they set out to accomplish
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and

Resolution No. 69

Superintendent Larry Holt
WHEREAS, we recognize the many
accomplishments and achievements of
Superintendent Larry Holt; and

under the Pastorate of the late Superintendent
Percy Phillips; and

WHEREAS, Superintendent Holt was
called into the ministry in 1984 and four years
later was appointed to pastorate over a flock

at 4303 Delmar, named Damascus Church Of

now “Jennings Mason Temple Church Of
God In Christ”; and

WHEREAS, Superintendent Holt
previously served as Jurisdictional Treasurer
and currently serves in the position of
National Adjutant and as Jurisdictional Sunday
School Superintendent; and
WHEREAS, in 2007 Superintendent
Holt was designated to serve as Pastor of the
Holy Temple Church Of God In Christ after
the homegoing of the beloved Superintendent
and former Pastor, Percy Phillips, and was
also appointed in the position of
Superintendent- District 4 previously held by
Superintendent Percy Phillips.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Superintendent
Larry Holt and we wish him continued success,
achievement and accomplishment and we

Resolution No. 70

Joseph Prophet
WHEREAS, we recognize Mr. Joseph
Prophet for his hard work and dedication to
gang abatement and youth development; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Prophet developed the
Youth Empowerment Services Program
(Y.E.S.) which is a “gang abatement” and
“youth development” initiative based upon a
comprehensive and holistic philosophy; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Prophet believes that
it requires programs like the Y.E.S .approach
in order to make a significant impact on the
array of problems that lead to delinquency in
our youth. Y.E.S. is an approach that is based
on fundamental assumption that the root of
the youth delinquency problem stem from the
connection between three primary factors in
the development of the child. The first factor
is the basic family structure. Factor number
two is the unique group of values that are
derived from the particular family structure.
Factor number three is the general thinking,

the particular thought processes and the
specific actions that proceed from the values;
and
WHEREAS, Mr. Prophet comes into
contact with youth in their program long after
the family and living environment has had their
affect. Given this reality and the thrust of the
Y.E.S. Program, the most effective role for the
coordinators is the engagement with the
students and attempt to interrupt or to halt
the progression of the problem. This is
accomplished by providing the students with
awareness of the issues that produced their
situation and by providing additional
information that could lead to better thinking
and decision making in the future; and
WHEREAS, when working with the
students, Mr. Prophet always look for ways
to involve members of the students’ family
and to intervene into the family structure; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Prophet realizes that
something can be done and that something
must be done. In answer to the question of
whether anything can be done to turn these
children around, Mr. Prophet says Y.E.S.
through the process of the Youth
Empowerment Services.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognized Mr. Joseph
Prophet for his hard work and dedication to
the St. Louis community and we wish him
continued success and achievement and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 71
Eddie Stallings
WHEREAS, we recognize Mr. Eddie
Stallings for his hard work and dedication to
gang abatement and youth development; and
WHEREAS, the Youth Empowerment
Services Program (Y.E.S.) is a “gang
abatement” and “youth development”
initiative based upon a comprehensive and
holistic philosophy; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Stallings believes that
it requires programs like the Y.E.S .approach

is the basic family structure. Factor number
two is the unique group of values that are

Factor number three is the general thinking,
the particular thought processes and the

and

WHEREAS, Mr. Stallings comes into

the family and living environment has had their

Y.E.S. Program, the most effective role for the
coordinators is the engagement with the
students and attempt to interrupt or to halt
the progression of the problem. This is
accomplished by providing the students with
awareness of the issues that produced their
situation and by providing additional
information that could lead to better thinking
and decision making in the future; and

WHEREAS, when working with the
students, Mr. Stallings always look for ways
to involve members of the students’ family
and to intervene into the family structure.
This is important because of the belief that
the family is the foundation for individual
human development. Families need to be
involved and Y.E.S. uses every opportunity
to encourage them and to assist them in being
supportive of the kinds of changes the students
need to make in order to redirect the course of
their live; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Stallings realizes that
something can be done and that something
must be done. In answer to the question of
whether anything can be done to turn these
children around, Mr. Stallings says Y.E.S.
through the process of the Youth
Empowerment Services.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

Delta Sigma Theta
WHEREAS, the St. Louis Metropolitan
Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority, Inc. was established under a mantra
of sisterhood, service and scholarship on
January 11, 1998; and

WHEREAS, a group of forty alumnae
reclaimed and five active Sorors committed to
calling themselves to a “higher order” of
purpose. Armed with a rich legacy, they
established an African-centered chapter
grounded in the spirit of sisterhood, which
focuses on leadership development, through
the five-point programmatic thrust; and

WHEREAS, by using creative initiatives
they sought to reclaim and retain Sorors in the
St. Louis Metropolitan area. ‘Come Home to
Delta and Bring Your Sister with You’ is the
mantra of the chapter with an emphasis on
reclaiming and retaining Sorors rather than
membership intake; and

Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta
Sorority, Inc. members are about fostering
sisterhood, while providing service to the
community. Diversity of membership is
another focus of the Chapter; and

WHEREAS, this Chapter was
established and principled upon educational
excellence, public service and leadership
development. The Chapter provides an
extensive array of public services aimed at a
five point programmatic thrust: Economic

Development, Educational Development,
International Awareness and Involvement,
Physical and Mental Health, and Political
Awareness and Involvement; and
WHEREAS, the St. Louis Metropolitan
Alumnae Chapter activities have involved
Delta members as volunteers in direct services,
catalysts for community action, recruiters of
interagency support, and leaders in networking
and partnership building with other
organizations.

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and congratulate the
