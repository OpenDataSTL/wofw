Resolution No. 131
Congressman John Lewis
WHEREAS, John Lewis was born the
son of sharecroppers on February 21, 1940,
outside of Troy, Alabama. On that day a great
leader in the struggle of civil rights was born;
and
WHEREAS, as a child, he was inspired
by the activism surrounding the Montgomery
Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr., which he heard on radio
broadcasts. In those pivotal moments, he
made a decision to become a part of the Civil
Rights Movement; and
WHEREAS, while a student at Fisk
University, John Lewis organized sit-in
demonstrations at segregated lunch counters
in Nashville, Tennessee and he volunteered to
participate in the Freedom Rides, which
challenged segregation at interstate bus
terminals across the South, risking his life and

also being beaten severely by angry mobs and
arrested by police for challenging the injustice
of Jim Crow segregation in the South. Mr.
Lewis was also named Chairman of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC); and

WHEREAS, by 1963, Mr. Lewis was
dubbed one of the Big Six Leaders of the Civil
Rights Movement. (along with Whitney
Young, A. Phillip Randolph, Martin Luther
King Jr., James Farmer and Roy Wilkins). At
the youthful age of 23, he was an architect of
and a keynote speaker at the historic March
on Washington in August 1963; and

WHEREAS, Congressman Lewis
coordinated SNCC efforts to organize voter
registration drives and community action
programs during the Mississippi Freedom
Summer and the following year helped lead
over 600 peaceful, orderly protestors across
the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama
on March 7, 1965. The marchers were
attacked by Alabama state troopers in a brutal
confrontation that became known as “Bloody
Sunday”
and news broadcasts and
photographs revealing this senseless cruelty
of the segregated South helped hasten the
passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; and

WHEREAS, despite the arrests and
attacks, John Lewis remained a devoted
advocate of the philosophy of nonviolence.
After leaving SNCC in 1966, he held positions
such as Associate Director of the Field,
Director of the Voter Education Project (VEP).
Under his leadership, the VEP transformed
the nation’s political climate by adding nearly
four million minorities to the voter rolls. In
1977, John Lewis was appointed by President
Jimmy Carter to direct more than 250,000
volunteers of ACTION, the federal volunteer
agency. In 1981, he was elected to the Atlanta
City Council. He was elected to Congress in
November 1986 and has served as U.S.
Representative of Georgia’s Fifth
Congressional District since then; and

WHEREAS, Congressman Lewis has
received countless awards, including the only
John F. Kennedy “Profile in Courage Award”
for Lifetime Achievement that has ever granted
by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
The Timberland Company has developed the
John Lewis Award, which honors the
Congressman’s commitment to humanitarian
service by acknowledging members of society
who perform outstanding humanitarian work
and the company has established a John Lewis
Scholarship Fund; and

WHEREAS, John Lewis holds a B.A.
in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk
University, and he is a graduate of the
American Baptist Theological Seminary, both

in Nashville, Tennessee. He has been awarded
over 50 honorary degrees from prestigious
colleges and universities throughout the
United States.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Congressman John
Lewis and his contribution to America and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes

FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Schmid introduced Resolutions No.
129 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 129

RESOLUTION FOR UNIVERSAL
ACCESS TO PUBLIC, EDUCATIONAL
& GOVERNMENT CHANNELS AND
SUPPORT OF H.R. 3745
WHEREAS, On June 8, 2010, Charter
Communications, Inc. transferred STL-TV (St.
Louis government), SLPS-TV (St. Louis Public
Schools), HEC-TV (higher education),
KDHX (Double Helix Public Programming),
and C-Span2 to digital channels on the 980998 public affairs neighborhood. At the same
time EWTN-TV (Catholic Programming), and
the weather and channel selections channels
were all moved from easy accessibility by
Basic Tier Cable users; and

WHEREAS, Public, Educational, and
Governmental (PEG) Programming Channels
play a significant informative, educational and
participatory role in our democracy and in
the City of St. Louis; and
WHEREAS, “Information is as vital to
the healthy functioning of communities as
clean air, safe streets, good schools and public
health”, according to the Knight Commission
Report, On the Information Needs of
Communities in a Democracy, December
2009); and
WHEREAS, the movement of these
PEG channels limits public access by placing
an unnecessary barrier to access, whose only
apparent
purpose
is
Charter
Communication’s profit — and even that could
backfire, if customers leave them. Charter’s
customers are blocked from accessing these
PEG channels unless they purchase monthly
digital box services or buy a digital television;
and
WHEREAS, it is critical to a wellinformed and participatory democracy that
we assure equal access to PEG channels and
preserve service provider funding for PEG
channels, so that these channels continue to
be available to the entire community and to
serve the residents of the City of St. Louis in
the manner in which they have become
accustomed; and
WHEREAS, there is currently pending
before Congress H.R. 3745, which would
establish the Community Access Preservation
(CAP) Act; and
WHEREAS, the CAP Act would amend
the Communications Act of 1934 to provide
for carriage and display of PEG channels
without additional charges, and via channels
whose quality, accessibility, functionality and
placement is consistent with commercial
channels; and
WHEREAS, the CAP Act would
preserve PEG channels and the much needed
funding for PEG facilities and operations, and
ensure that the channels continue to be
available to the entire community; and
WHEREAS, the CAP Act would
provide important solutions for critical and
immediate financial needs of PEG channels
and facilities by unrestricting the use of PEG
franchise fees for any PEG related purpose;
and
WHEREAS, the CAP Act would require
the Federal Communications Commission to
submit a report to Congress relative to the
impact of state video service franchising laws
on PEG cable systems and channels since
2005; and

WHEREAS, in states that have enacted
state level franchising laws since May 31,
2005, the CAP Act would require each cable
operator to continue to provide financial and
infrastructure support and channel capacity
based on the support historically provided
by the cable operator; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act ensures
technological neutrality by applying PEG
requirements to all landline video service
providers, regardless of the transmission
protocol.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT BY THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF THE CITY
OF ST. LOUIS, that we pause in our
deliberations to support H.R. 3745, which
would establish the Community Access
Preservation (CAP) Act and amend the
Communications Act of 1934 to provide for
carriage and display of public, educational,
and governmental (PEG) channels in a manner
consistent with commercial channels. We
further urge our U.S. Congressional Delegation
to take all possible actions in support of the
passage of H.R. 3745, including but not limited
to endorsing, co-sponsoring, working for
rapid passage, and voting for H.R. 3745. We
further direct the Clerk of this Board to prepare
a copy of this Resolution and mail it to each
member of our U.S. Congressional Delegation:
Senator Christopher “Kit” Bond, Senator
Claire McCaskill, Representative William
“Lacy” Clay and Representative Russ
Carnahan.
