locally brewed beer to support a parish picnic
or neighborhood organization gathering;
providing beer and financial support for
special causes like the Streets Department

corporation house tours, senior centers and
many, many more. Especially in times of
community crisis, such as the tragic deaths of
two Saint Louis Fire Fighters a few years ago,
Rod Forth and Anheuser-Busch have been
there for the people of our community; and
WHEREAS, Rod helped launch what is
now regarded as one of the premier civic events
of the year in Saint Louis with the founding
sponsorship of the acclaimed Mayor’s Mardi

Hall and which Rod and Patty Forth have
served as Honorary Chairs every year; and

Resolution No. 233
Chuck Decker
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Chuck Decker will be retiring after 28 years
as an Iron Worker; and
WHEREAS, Chuck was accepted for
Apprenticeship in 1970 and worked in the
field for 28 years as an apprentice,
Journeyman, Union Steward, Foreman,
General Foreman and Superintendent; and
WHEREAS, Chuck has previously held
the elected positions of Local Union Trustee,
one term; Executive Board Member, two
terms; Vice President, two terms; President/
Business Agent, three terms; and Delegate to
the International Convention, on three
occasions; and
WHEREAS, Chuck married Nancy
Spinelli in 1971 and has two children, Phil, an
Iron Worker for 15 years and executive Board
Member of 396 and Ellen, the first Decker to
graduate from college; and
WHEREAS, Chuck is the proud
grandfather of two beautiful grandchildren,
Charlize and Willa; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Alderman is
happy to learn of Chuck’s retirement-so he
no longer has influence and we can finally
speak honestly about him without fear of
retribution; and
WHEREAS, Chuck’s life and career is a
remarkable, given his lack of talent and bad
personality; and
WHEREAS, regarding his talent,
consider that it took Chuck three attempts to
find a high school that would graduate him,
and his work as an ironworker was so bad the
membership of 396 elected him to office in
order to stop him from destroying the
reputation of the quality of their work; and
WHEREAS, regarding his personality,
let’s just say Chuck is a hard person to be
around. Consider how several restaurants
requested that Chuck not return after
complaints from other patrons who were in
viewing distance of Chuck devouring a meal;
and

WHEREAS, some people thought that
Chuck was always the last to leave the party,
when in reality, when Chuck got to the party
it was over-everyone would leave; and
WHEREAS, perhaps the most
remarkable thing about Chuck’s career is that
he reached retirement age, given that his driving
is so bad no other officer of 396 will ride with
him out of fear of leaving their children as
orphans; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen
want to express their appreciation to the
members of Local 396 for providing
employment to Chuck these last 28 years as
we are sure that Chuck could not have found
work anywhere else.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberation to recognize the many
achievements of Chuck Decker in his 28 year
career as an Iron Worker and we further direct
the Clerk of this Board to spread a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 232
The Miles Davis Festival
WHEREAS, the mission of the Miles
Davis Festival is to educate the public about
the music of Miles Davis and to encourage
the public to explore all kinds of music,
particularly jazz. The first annual festival will
take place in June 2009. To ensure that all
members of society have the opportunity to
hear some of the world’s most talented
musicians, the event will be free to the public;
and
WHEREAS, jazz legend Miles Davis
was born in the St. Louis region, and he spent
his formative years here. Throughout his
acclaimed career, Davis has been a leader in

almost every important jazz movement in the
20th Century such as bebop, modal jazz and
jazz-fusion; and

WHEREAS, Davis has earned
recognition from his musical peers on many
occasions including a 1960 Grammy Award, a
1970 Grammy Award and a 1990 Grammy
Lifetime Achievement Award. In addition to
his Grammy awards, Davis has earned
membership in several prestigious groups
including, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Hollywood’s
Rockwalk.

WHEREAS, Davis’ friends and family
believe in the need for an annual tribute to him
in his hometown. The new Miles Davis
Festival will build upon a successful birthday
concert for Davis that was held in 2001 in
East St. Louis, which attracted an audience of
3,000. Quincy Troupe and Eugene B.
Redmond, close Davis friends organized the
2001 tribute. Quincy Troupe is a renowned
writer and poet who coauthored, Miles, the
Autobiography, and wrote, Miles and Me, a
personal memoir of his friendship with Davis.
Eugene B. Redmond is an Emeritus Professor
of English at SIUE and the editor of
“Drumvoices Revue.” Troupe and Redmond
are the leaders of the Miles Davis Festival;
and

WHEREAS, the Miles Davis Festival
will have multiple activities for the public to
experience the magic of Davis and the artistry
of jazz. Planned activities include: Showcase
Free Concerts featuring InternationallyKnown Artists, Literary Showcases, Youth
Music Workshops, Miles Davis Multi-Media
Pavilion, the Miles Marketplace and the Miles
Fare.

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to call upon the City of St. Louis
to support the Miles Davis Festival and work
in conjunction with officials from East St.
Louis to make the annual Miles Davis Festival
a great success. Hopefully, in the near future
a concurrent resolution between the cities of
St. Louis and East St. Louis will be formed.
