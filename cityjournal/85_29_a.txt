FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Shrewsbury introduced Resolution
No. 180 and requested that it be assigned to
the committee on Health & Human Services.

Resolution No. 180
WHEREAS, the St. Louis City Board
of Aldermen is committed to efforts and
supports initiatives that will enhance the
quality of life of all citizens of Missouri; and
WHEREAS, programs to fund hospital
trauma care and emergency preparedness;
health care treatment and access; prescription
drug assistance for seniors; health care
initiatives for low income citizens, women,
minorities and children; tobacco prevention
and cessation programs; and research to help
find the cures to some of the most devastating
diseases afflicting our citizens will help make
Missouri a healthier place for all; and
WHEREAS, thousands of Missourians
die each year from trauma and Missouri’s
trauma and emergency preparedness systems
are terribly under-resourced and overburdened; and
WHEREAS, the cost of prescription
drugs is escalating out of control and Missouri
seniors need relief; and
WHEREAS, childhood care and
education programs can ensure that Missouri
children have healthy minds and bodies, and
start school ready to learn; and
WHEREAS, smoking prevention and
cessation programs to reach our children
before they start will ensure that more
Missourians choose a healthy, tobacco free
lifestyle; and
WHEREAS, studies show aggressive
tobacco prevention campaigns are effective
and do deter children from taking up the
deadly habit. But, Missouri ranks dead last in
the nation when it comes to investing in
tobacco prevention efforts; and
WHEREAS, Missouri is an evolving
leader in research to find treatment and cures
for our deadliest disease, but the effort needs
support; and
WHEREAS, a 55 cent increase in the
excise tax on a pack of cigarettes, and an
additional tax of 20 percent of the
manufacturer’s invoice for other tobacco
products would generate net annual revenues
of approximately $342,636,000; and
WHEREAS,
Missourians
overwhelmingly support raising the tobacco
tax to improve the health and health care in
Missouri, as evidenced by the nearly 130,000
Missourians who signed the petition to place
this initiative on the ballot;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis that we support the Healthy
Missouri ballot initiative to amend the

Missouri law to impose an additional excise
tax of 55 cents per pack–and 20 percent on
other tobacco products to be placed in the
Healthy Families Trust Fund to be used for
the following purposes: hospital trauma care
and emergency preparedness; health care
treatment and access; prescription drug
assistance for seniors; health care initiatives
for low income citizens, women, minorities
and children; life sciences research, including
medical research and the proper administration
of funds for such research; tobacco prevention
and cessation programs and grants for early
childhood care and education;
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED
that this new law will help make Missouri a
healthier place by improving the health of our
children, our seniors and our families.

Introduced the 11th day of October, 2002 by:
Honorable Lyda Krewson, Alderwoman 28th Ward
Honorable Irving Clay, Jr., Alderman 26th Ward
Mr. Reed introduced Resolution No. 185
and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 185
WHEREAS, on Tuesday, November
5,2002, voters in the City of St. Louis and
across the State of Missouri will be asked to
entrust their vote, and their future, to one of
two major candidates seeking to represent
Missouri in the United States Senate; and
WHEREAS, it has come to the attention
of this Board that one of the candidates, former
Representative Jim Talent, has an established
record that is in direct conflict with the best
interests of the residents of the City of St.
Louis, including numerous issues of significant
importance such as health care, economic
development, prescription drugs, labor, Health
Care in Underserved areas and Aid to Single
Mothers; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Talent introduced the
“Real Welfare Reform Act” in 1994, which
cut off benefits to unwed mothers and reduced
welfare spending by $70 billion; and
WHEREAS, He explained that the
children of these mothers would not be
punished because he intended to give the
money instead to states, who could use the
funds to take care of the children, through the
re-establishment of state-run orphanages.
(Post-Dispatch, 6/18/94); and
WHEREAS, Talent justified this
proposal by claiming that welfare was the
cause of illegitimate births, which leading
experts around the country decried as
misguided and untrue. (Post-Dispatch, 5/17/
94)
WHEREAS, Moderate Republicans,
including then Sen. Majority Leader Bob Dole,
quickly backed away from Talent’s welfare
proposal after the election of 1994, and Newt
Gingrich ultimately abandoned the plan
because of a lack of support. (Los Angeles
Times, 12/2/94 and KC Star, 11/21/94)

WHEREAS, Mr. Talent has shown a
lack of commitment to providing our
community, our children and single parents
across this nation with interim support, by
voting against $3 billion for a program to help
welfare recipients find work (Education and
Workforce vote on 6/12/97), voting against
extending technical training allowance for
persons moving from welfare to work.

(Education and Workforce vote on 11/3/99)
and by his plan to bring back state-run
orphanages.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis that we support the single
parents requiring Aid in our community, and
their right to have an opportunity to rebuild
their lives and to raise their children, and
