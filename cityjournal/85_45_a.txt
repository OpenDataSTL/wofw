by Iraq; and

and terrorism; and

WHEREAS, The citizens of the City of
St. Louis and their local elected officials have
the constitutional right to petition the national

Mr. Bosley introduced Resolution No.
270 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 270
WHEREAS, on January 16, 2003,
Governor Bob Holden announced that
beginning February 1, 2003, the General Relief
checks provided to needy and medically
unemployable adults in the State of Missouri
will be reduced from $80 per month to $9 per
month; and

WHEREAS, General Relief checks are
provided to disabled adults who are
unemployed and not eligible for any other type
of financial assistance; and

WHEREAS, this monthly grant is being
reduced as a result of the Missouri State
Legislatures failure to approve a budget with
sufficient funds to provide the $80 per month
subsidy for the entire fiscal year; and
WHEREAS, Governor Holden has also
proposed totally eliminating the General
Relief program from the budget currently
under debate by the Missouri General
Assembly; and
WHEREAS, the loss of these funds will
have a devastating effect on the most needy
of our citizens, forcing many of them to
become homeless and all of them to become
desperate in their struggle to meet basic
survival needs; and
WHEREAS, the loss of this program will
also cause those who are losing this funding
to seek assistance elsewhere, thus
overwhelming the many private assistance
programs available in this city and throughout
the State;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis that we are opposed to the
elimination of the General Relief program for
our needy citizens, as proposed by Governor
Holden and we strongly urge the Missouri
General Assembly to make an emergency
appropriation this session to properly fund
the General Relief account in order to restore
the monthly benefit to $80 per month and we
further urge the General Assembly and
Governor Holden to provide sufficient funds
in next year’s budget to continue this vital
program and we direct the Clerk of this Board
to send a copy of this Resolution to Governor
Holden and to the Missouri Senate and House
of Representatives.
Introduced the 31st day of January, 2003 by:

Unanimous consent having been

considered.
Mr. Bosley moved that Resolution No.
270 be adopted, at this meeting of the Board.
Seconded by Ms. Flowers.
Carried unanimously by voice vote.
Mr. Bosley introduced Resolution No.
271 and requested that it be assigned to the
Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs for
hearing.

Resolution No. 271

WHEREAS, in 1994, the Missouri
General Assembly adopted Senate Bill 432,
codified as Section 94.660 RSMo, as amended
(the “Prop M Tax Act”), which authorizes
the City and County to levy up to a one-half
cent sales tax for public transportation
purposes, on the approval of the voters of
both the City and County of such tax; and

WHEREAS, on August 2, 1994, a
majority of the voters of both the City and
the County, respectively, approved the
imposition of a one-quarter cent sales tax,
known as the Proposition M Sales Tax (the
“Prop MSales Tax”), for the purpose of
providing a source of funds for public
transportation purposes; and

WHEREAS, since 1994 the City and
County have annually appropriated funds
from the Prop M Sales Tax for transfer to the
Bi-State Development Agency (“the Agency”)
for the purpose of funding the Agency*s
public transportation purposes;

WHEREAS, in 1995 the East-West
Gateway Coordinating Council (“EWGCC”),
in conjunction with the Missouri Department
of Transportation and the Agency, authorized
federally mandated studies of multimodal
transportation improvements in a specified
corridor including the Terminal Railroad Track
and Citizens for Modem Transit right-of-way
referred to herein; and

WHEREAS, in 1997 EWGCC approved
expansion of the Agency*s light rail transit
system known as MetroLink in the CrossCounty corridor (the “Project,” as hereinafter
defined) and approved a route for the Project
based upon a report from the consulting firm
of Gannett Fleming which evaluated alignment
issues and funding options for the light rail
expansion (Gannett Fleming, Cross-County
Strategic Alignment Analysis, East-West
Coordinating Council); and

WHEREAS, in 1998 and 1999 EWGCC
coterminously completed the MTIA
Community Engagement Baseline Report
(“MTIA Report”); and

WHEREAS, the Northside study area,
covered in the MTIA Report, is a 77-squaremile area that includes both the northern part
of St. Louis City and the northern part of St.
Louis County; and

WHEREAS, census data indicates that
fewer automobiles are available to occupied
housing units within the Northside study area
than are available to the region as a whole, a
situation which is primarily due to the fact
that in approximately 40 percent of all
occupied housing units in the North City were
without automobiles and, thus, were highly
transit-dependent; and

WHEREAS, this is a much larger
percentage of homes without access to
automobiles than in the entire City (29
percent), the region (11 percent), and the
County portion of the study area (8.5 percent)
and contributes to general lack of opportunity
in the Northside study area; and
WHEREAS, compared to the other study
areas and the region as a whole, the Northside
study area can be described as poorer and more
transit-dependent, with less job growth and
fewer opportunities for investment and
development; and
WHEREAS, MetroLink does not serve
the transit-dependent population on the
Northside; and
WHEREAS, unless our region*s leaders
recognize low-income workers as important
participants in a shared regional economy and
until our public policies and investments are
better aligned with the goal of full
employment, access to jobs will be an
afterthought; and
WHEREAS, the East-West Gateway
Coordinating Council and the Bi-State
Development Agency have earned plaudits for
the skill with which they have cost effectively
introduced and popularized MetroLink;
however, costs are escalating and hopes for
further rapid transit growth during the next
thirty years are vanishing; and
WHEREAS, in order to change this
ominous outlook five steps need to be taken:
1) provide new transit options, 2) extend rapid
transit further now, 3) serve more transitdependent citizens, 4) stay within the current
budget, 4) improve public trust and support;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT
RESOLVED BY BOARD OF ALDERMEN
OF THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS, THAT:
Section 1. we reaffirm our support for
the extension of MetroLink provided that the
Agency and EWGCC judiciously address and
make changes to the Project based on their
findings from the following overlooked tasks:
A. careful consideration of the impacts
on transit-dependent citizens and
communities within the Cross-County
Extension corridor of the Project;
B. serious evaluation of Repositioning
the CCE and Substituting BRT in terms of
savings, economic stimulus, and better serving
the public;
C. creation of a comprehensive transit
plan for the St. Louis region.
Section 2. In addition, this Board hereby
urges that all funding for future projects of
the Agency be withheld pending completion
of the above.

Section 3. mindful of our fiscal and moral
responsibility to the St. Louis region, we
declares our willingness to lead in calling for a
rigorous and forward looking approach
towards meeting our transit needs, so that
everyone benefits equitably.
