Resolution No. 339
Committee Substitute
RESOLUTION URGING CESSATION
OF COMBAT OPERATIONS IN IRAQ
AND THE RETURN OF U.S. TROOPS
WHEREAS, the authorization for the
use of military force against Iraq, Resolution
of 2002, was passed by the U.S. Congress on
October 11, 2002, and that Public Law 107243 cited Iraq’s possession of “weapons of
mass destruction” as one of the primary
reasons for the use of U.S. military power
against Iraq; and
WHEREAS, the United States initiated
combat operations in Iraq on March 19, 2003
in part to find the reported weapons of mass
destruction and since no weapons of mass
destruction were found, President Bush
officially declared an end to the search for
these weapons in Iraq on January 12, 2005;
and
WHEREAS, hundreds of thousands of
members of the United States Armed Forces
have served with honor and distinction in Iraq
with more than 4,000 of them having been
killed and more than 60,000 of them having
been wounded in substantially accomplishing
the stated purpose of the United States for
entering Iraq, clearly determining that Iraq is
free of any supposed arsenal of weapons of
mass destruction and toppling the government
of Saddam Hussein; and
WHEREAS, the United States military
occupation of Iraq has placed significant
strains on the capacity of the United States
Armed Forces including the National Guard,
both active duty and reserve; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. State Department
noted that the Iraqi Security Forces number
more than 355,000 troops as of January 2008
and are growing in number and capability
daily; and
WHEREAS, nearly $500 billion has been
appropriated by Congress to fund military
operations and reconstruction in Iraq, with

Missouri residents’ share now exceeding
estimates of $7.5 billion and St. Louis’
residents share now exceeding $335 million as
calculated by the National Priorities Project;
and

WHEREAS, in February 2007
congressional hearings determined that nearly
$10 billion of the monies expended on the war
effort in Iraq have been “mismanaged and
wasted”; and

WHEREAS, $4.6 billion in tax dollars
paid to the Halliburton Corporation and the
former Halliburton division, KBR, were
deemed “unreasonable and unsupportable” by
Pentagon auditors and according to the
Brookings Institute Iraq Index, hundreds of
millions of tax payers monies have
disappeared due to military equipment being
“lost and unaccounted for”; and

WHEREAS, the funds spent by St.
Louis taxpayers on the war and occupation in
Iraq could have provided Head Start for one
year for 45,562 children; or medical insurance
for one year for 33,429 children; or 1,996
public school teachers for one year; or 939
affordable housing units, according to the
National Priorities Project; and

WHEREAS, the war and continued
occupation of Iraq has resulted in the
devastation of Iraq’s physical and social
infrastructure and led to widespread and
continuous resistance to U.S. occupation that
threatens the lives of Iraqi civilians and the
men and women who compose the ranks of
U.S. Armed forces; and

WHEREAS, the presence of United
States forces in Iraq and the alleged torture of
prisoners at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba and other facilities have inflamed antiAmerican passions in significant portions of
the Muslim world and increased the terrorist
threat to United States citizens, both at home
and abroad; and

WHEREAS, the continued US
occupation of Iraq has precipitated the fastestgrowing refugee crisis in the world displacing
nearly one fifth of that country’s population
either internally or externally, in addition to
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi
civilians according to studies by the British
medical journal, The Lancet and the Johns
Hopkins University School of Public Health;
and

WHEREAS, such destabilization and
destruction is fueling instability in the
surrounding region which threatens the
security of all Americans with various U.S.
polls, including media tabulations, showing
that less than half of the American people
support the war.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED, that the St. Louis City Board
of Aldermen urges the United States Congress
and the President to immediately commence
an orderly and rapid withdrawal of United
States military personnel from Iraq, while
assisting the Iraqi people to rebuild and
reconstruct and that the financial resources
used for the war be redirected to address the
urgent needs of America’s great cities, the most
vulnerable portions of the U.S. population
and to address urgent domestic health, housing
and education crises that America faces and
further directs the Clerk of this Board to
prepare a fitting copy of this resolution so
that in the end it may be presented to those
deemed appropriate by its sponsor.
