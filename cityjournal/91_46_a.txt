Resolution No. 295
Joan Jennings
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Joan Jennings has been recognized as the Shaw
Neighborhood Person of the Year; and
WHEREAS, the Shaw Neighborhood’s
success is due in large part to a handful of
residents who quietly go about working to
improve, promote and sustain the positive
attributes of living in Shaw. In 2008, one
person’s efforts have stood above the rest,
Joan Jennings demonstrates a dedication to
the Shaw Neighborhood that few can match;
and
WHEREAS, for years Joan has been
Shaw’s liaison to the Grand South Grand

role organizing the Shaw House Tour, including
chairing the 2008 Home and Garden Tour. Joan
has played an integral part in ensuring that
the best of Shaw Homes has been on display
for thousands of people who have attended
these popular events over the years; and
WHEREAS, Joan has served as a past
president of the Shaw Neighborhood

Improvement Association, where she was
instrumental in the neighborhood’s efforts to
combat problem properties. She has worked
to ensure the institutional memory of Shaw,
serving several terms as Secretary of the SNIA
executive committee; and

WHEREAS, in 2008 Joan’s knowledge
of the City and her dedication to the continued
safety of the Shaw Neighborhood were
instrumental in getting the Shaw Business
District initiative placed on the ballot; and

among countless others in her years of service
to her community, Joan Jennings is the

Resolution No. 296

WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Compton Gate Condominiums has been
recognized as the Shaw Neighborhood
Development of the Year; and

WHEREAS, It is an enormous
accomplishment to design, finance, build and
market a major new high- quality residential
construction project, especially in a historic
city neighborhood. The developer’s of
Compton Gate Condominiums did exactly
that, which is a notable accomplishment in
itself; and

perhaps is that Ken Nuernberger and Michele

built and sold the Compton Gate
Condominiums not once but practically twice;
and

substantially underway with several units

and later a vacant lot, is now a superior
development that lives up to the history and
architecture of its surroundings in the Shaw
Neighborhood.
