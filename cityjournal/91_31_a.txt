Resolution No. 185

Leonard Missionary Baptist Church
WHEREAS, the history of Leonard
Missionary Baptist Church spans beyond the
celebrated 145 years. There is documentation
stating Rev. William M. S. Cutheon, Pastor
and David Bush, Clerk, organized the original
church in 1852; and

WHEREAS, the annually recorded
history states that Leonard’s inception was
in 1861 when the foundation was laid by a
few consecrated and determined Christians to
meet the spiritual needs of a lost community.
At this time, the church was operating under
the name of St. Mark’s Baptist Church, under
the leadership of Rev. DeBrill; and

WHEREAS, the Church has a Legacy
of Pastors. At this time their exact dates of
service to LMBC aren’t really available;
however, they are honored in their own rights.
The Past Shepherds, (excluding those
aforementioned) were Rev. G.A. Friley; Rev.
G. P. Hopewell; Rev. W. J. Davis; Rev. D. W.
Titus and Rev. S. E. Tanner. Past Assistant
Pastors were Rev. P. Temple; Rev. D. W.
Edwards; Rev. J. Mixon; Rev. C. T. O’Kelly;
Rev. B. Harris and Rev. L. A. Kirby. In 1916,
under the leadership of Rev. P. W. Dunavant,
D.D., the property at 104 S. Leonard Avenue
was purchased, and later the name was changed
to Leonard Avenue Baptist Church. In 1923,
the corner stone was laid. Rev. Dunavant
began ardent work, which resulted in the
burning of the mortgage on the old church. A
lot was purchased and the construction on

the first new brick church was started; and
WHEREAS, in 1936, the Union
Missionary Baptist Church consolidated with
Leonard Avenue Baptist Church and the name
became Leonard Avenue Consolidated
Missionary Baptist Church. In 1938, under
the guidance of Assistant Pastor, Rev. W. J.
Davis, the Board of Education of the City of
St. Louis purchased the Leonard Avenue
Consolidated Missionary Baptist Church. In
1939, under the leadership of three Assistant
Pastors, Rev. Lee Kirby, Rev. J. Mixon and
Rev. C. T. O’Kelly, who found the location.
Leonard moved to 3105 Cass Avenue. The
church paid cash for the property and the
house next door; and
WHEREAS, this name remained until
1943 when Rev. W. E. W. Brown became
Pastor of Leonard. Under his leadership, the
words “Avenue” and “Consolidated” were
deleted and the name became Leonard
Missionary Baptist Church. Rev. Brown
pastured Leonard for twenty-eight years, from
1943-1971. He began to make in-depth plans
for the church from the beginning of his
pastoral. Leonard moved from the Cass
Avenue location to 1220 North Grand
Boulevard on the third Sunday in December,
1945. After the completion of this move,
many improvements were made. One major
improvement was the front of the church as
perma-stoned; and
WHEREAS, on February 18, 1996,
during an 8:00 a.m. High Praise Service,
tragedy struck in the form of fire and totally
destroyed the historical edifice known as
“Leonard Baptist”. Due to the quick thinking
and clear instructions of Rev. Carl
Cunningham, the congregation was evacuated
safely, without the loss of life or serious injury.
In the words of Pastor Thompson, “The
Building Burned, but the Church Still Stands;
and
WHEREAS, on March 12, 1997 the
church purchased eight (8) acres of land for
the sole purpose of building a new community
based LMBC, located at 1100 North Compton
Avenue. On Saturday, September 6, 1997 the
“Official Groundbreaking Services” were
celebrated. Many technicalities delayed the
progress of building the “new church;”
however, God’s plan prevailed. On Sunday,
May 30, 1999 the Leonard M. B. Church
family, led by their Pastor and Wife marched
from the original site (1220 N. Grand) to their
new edifice at its present location.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Leonard Missionary
Baptist Church and we wish them continued

success, triumph and accomplishment and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honorees at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 186

Eldon F. Arteaga
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Eldon F. Arteaga has won the Public
Communications-Certificate of Merit which
will be presented on November 10, 2008; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Arteaga has
volunteered much of his time to work with
the Gateway Arch and provide presentations
to local civic groups, patrons of several area
library branches and schools. These
presentations feature his photography and
explicit details about the Gateway Arch
project. The photography and his details offer
the young and old the opportunity to not only
hear, but also see the historical story details
about this project and how it changed St. Louis
forever; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Arteaga has chronicled
the construction of St. Louis’ greatest
architectural and construction achievement, the
Gateway Arch, and had overcome his fear of
heights to make a permanent record of the
Arch’s construction for future generations to
appreciate. As he visited construction sites,
he always captured the dignity and ingenuity
of the men and women working in the noise
and grit to build the structures where citizens
would work, play, heal, worship, learn and
live. He always has a smile to share and
happiness to leave behind, oftentimes giving
others a unique photo, an Arteaga book on
construction of the Arch, a poster or a
memorable story. In each instance, Mr.
Arteaga has been a living example of respecting
the rights, beliefs and gifts of others while
also freely giving sympathy, understanding
and help; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Arteaga has always
demonstrated a great appreciation for our
cultural diversity. He has shared his
appreciation of his own Spanish ancestry
while expressing great interest in the heritage
of others, making him a welcome member of
any gathering; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Arteaga is a devoted
husband, father, grandfather and friend. He
has welcomed and helped his children when
life has thrown curve balls and had a hand in
raising some of his grandchildren as

circumstances asked of him. He certainly
excels in doing his best to meet his own and
his families’ needs.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate Eldon F. Arteaga
for his accomplishment and we wish him
continued success and direct the Clerk of this
Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to further prepare a commemorative copy to
the end that it may be presented to our honoree

Resolution No. 187
Carolyn Recke
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Carolyn Recke is a recipient of the George
Washington Honor Medal Plaque and she will
be honored on November 10, 2008; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Recke civic
involvement begins first by teaching in the St.
Louis Public Schools. Carolyn is a National
Board Certified Teacher that could be teaching
in any district throughout Missouri. But
instead, she feels her civic duty is to the
children who have the least. Mrs. Recke
teaches in an urban district to give the children
a role model and to instill in them the value of
good citizenship. For most of her children,
her classroom is the only exposure they
receive on learning to become patriotic and
involved citizens; and
WHEREAS, as a teacher in the St. Louis
Pubic School District, Ms. Recke became
active in the Parent Teacher Organization and
began attending the board of education
meetings and found the children needed a voice
on the school board; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Recke has one son
serving in the armed forces, a daughter who is
doing great in college and another son in his
senior year who is an award-winning artist.
All three attended the St. Louis Public
Schools. Carolyn has taught each of them to
be active and honorable citizens who make a
positive contribution to society. It is not only
her teaching that lead to her own children’s
education as well as her student’s education
in citizenship; it is her action and community
involvement; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Recke is a nationally
certified teacher through the National Board
for Professional Teaching Standards.
NOW

THEREFORE

BE

IT

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate Carolyn Recke
for her accomplishment and we wish her
continued success and direct the Clerk of this
Board to spread a copy of this Resolution

to further prepare a commemorative copy to
