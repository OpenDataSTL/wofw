to whom was referred the following
Resolution, report that they have considered
the same and recommend adoption.

Resolution No. 149

for a Writ of Mandamus filed in the TwentySecond Judicial Circuit in the City of St. Louis,
a Circuit Judge ordered St. Louis Fire

on the theory that an appointing authority
within the civil service system must fill an
employment vacancy if there is a certified list
of qualified applicants and the appointing
authority requests a copy of such list; and

interpreted to mean that all civil service
vacancies must be filled if there is a list of
qualified applicants; and

an immediate and adverse effect on the city
budget; and

circuit court order be reviewed closely by the

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
