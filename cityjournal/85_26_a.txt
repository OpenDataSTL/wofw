Mr. Bosley requested that Resolution
No. 157 be referred to the Public Safety
Committee for hearing.

Resolution No. 157
WHEREAS, recently the City of St.
Louis once again witnessed the tragedy that
can occur as a result of a high speed chase by
St. Louis police officers in pursuit of alleged
perpetrators of criminal activity; and
WHEREAS, the latest incident resulted
in the death of a young police officer and
serious injury to his partner; and
WHEREAS, it is without argument that
a high speed automobile chase through the
streets of this city place all involved, as well
as innocent citizens, in grave danger; and
WHEREAS , as the legislative body for
the City of St. Louis, it is well within the
purvey of this Board to inquire and
investigation into any situation or policy
which impacts the public safety and welfare;
particularly when such situation or policy is
under the control of a public body such as the
St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department;
and
WHEREAS, an extensive and public
examination of the Police Department’s policy
regarding high speed chases can have the
positive effect of identifying the advantages
and disadvantages of such policy and provide
an opportunity for public comment and
appropriate recommendations to improve the
policy in order to better protect the rights of
citizens;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we direct the Public
Safety Committee to convene a series of
hearings in order to discuss the current policy
of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police
Department regarding high speed chases. We
further direct such committee to call any and
all necessary witnesses, including members

of the Board of Police Commissioners, and to
request any and all necessary documents in
order to fully investigate the policy and
procedures currently employed by the Police
Department for such chases. We further
authorize the Public Safety Committee to
exercise the power of subpoena, as the
committee may deem necessary, in order to
secure such witnesses and documents. At the
conclusion of the hearings, we direct the
Committee to submit a report of its findings
and recommendations to the full Board of
Aldermen.

Introduced on the 20th day of September, 2002
by:
Honorable James (Jay) Ozier, Alderman 22nd Ward

Unanimous consent having been
obtained Resolution No. 164 stood
considered.
Mr. Ozier moved that Resolution No.
164 be adopted, at this meeting of the Board.
Seconded by Mr. Kirner.
Carried unanimously by voice vote.

Mr. Bauer introduced Resolution No.
165 and requested that it be assigned to the
Committee on Rules & Resolutions for
hearing.

WHEREAS, the St. Louis PostDispatch Platform statement of Joseph
Pulitzer, dated April 10, 1907, continues as
the statement of journalistic principles which
the Post-Dispatch aspires to, to wit: “always
fight for progress and reform”...”never lack
sympathy with the poor”...”always remain
devoted to the public welfare”...”always be
drastically independent.”

WHEREAS, the Post-Dispatch is the
primary print news outlet in St. Louis, and
that common journalistic norms of conduct
exercised under the protection of the First
Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States mandate accurate full and timely
coverage of issues of public importance,
especially those issues which require a vote
of the people, the peoples’ intelligent vote
being to a degree conditioned on the accurate
free flow of information.
WHEREAS, the persons charged with
this public trust are: Robert C. Woodworth,
President and CEO; Terrance C. Z. Egger,
President and Publisher; Matthew G. Kraner,
General Manager; Ellen Soeteber, Editor; Arnie
Robbins, Managing Editor; Christine A.
Bertelson, Editorial Page Editor.
WHEREAS, one of the most important
public policy questions in St. Louis City has
been the resolution and settlement of the
desegregation lawsuit, the deleterious impact
of which has stretched over three decades.
“THE ST. LOUIS STUDENT BILL OF
RIGHTS (hereinafter SLSBR) was a part of
the 1998 legislation settling the law suit. The
provisions of the SLSBR were fashioned to
resolve the vexing legal and societal issues that
were experienced as a part of the 30 year long
history of court supervision of the St. Louis
School System.
WHEREAS, the Transition School
District which was charged with the duty to
transmit the SLSBR ballot issue to the Board
of Election Commissioners failed and refused
to transmit it for a vote of the people at the
March 1999 primary election. Said failure
and refusal constituted a violation of suffrage
rights which necessitated a mandamus action
in the Circuit Court seeking an order requiring
compliance with statutory duties.
WHEREAS, the conduct and lack of
coverage by the Post-Dispatch relating to the
SLSBR referendum ballot proposition
violated common journalistic norms and calls
for its censure both by this Honorable Board
of Aldermen and its media peers nationally.
WHEREAS, the following is a bill of
particulars evidencing the Post-Dispatch’s
violation of common journalistic norms, to
wit:
1. There was no news article in 1998
which noted the failure of the Transition
School Board to vote on or transmit the
SLSBR. (except those related to the mandamus
action) Since the P.D. assumedly did not favor
the SLSBR it did not care to report that the
peoples right to vote had been violated. While
doing business under the shield of the First
Amendment it callously refused to publicize

the violation of voting rights of St. Louisans.
There was no demand for redress. Instead
there was silence.
2. As a part of the history of the
litigation, the case was argued in the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
on May 18, 2001. There was no article relating
to the argument.
3. The Eighth Circuit handed down its
opinion on July 2, 2001. There was no article
relating to the appellate decision. This
decision radically altered the legal perception
of the nature of the desegregation settlement.
According to the court it was essentially a
contract between the parties rather than a
mandate of the federal district court.
4. The case was remanded back to the
state trial court, Judge Robert Dierker in
Division 3. There was no article relating to
the remand order.
5. The case was tried on October 11,
2001. There was no coverage of the trial.
6. The editorial board of the P.D. has
refused to engage in a discussion of the
provisions of SLSBR with its author, Tom
Bauer 24th Ward Alderman who previously
served in the Missouri General Assembly.
7. The provisions of the SLSBR,
according P.D. poling data was supported by
81% of the 502 voters sampled in 1999. The
SLSBR is attached hereto and made a part
hereof by reference. The P.D. is attempting
to thwart the public will by engaging in a news
blackout.
8. This news blackout is a conscious,
malicious, plan on the part of employees of
the PD and others working in conspiracy with
them to alter the outcome of the November 5,
2002 in derogation of the P.D.’s duty to
provide for the free, fair, and honest flow of
information necessary to the voting public for
the exercise of their franchise rights.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis that the conduct of the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch violates journalistic and
ethical norms; that said deviation is harmful
to the welfare of the City of St. Louis; that
the persons responsible for said violations of
public trust are Robert C. Woodworth,
President and CEO; Terrance C. Z. Egger,
President and Publisher; Matthew G. Kraner,
General Manager; Ellen Soeteber, Editor; Arnie
Robbins, Managing Editor; and Christine A.
Bertelson, Editorial Page Editor.
