on the following non-binding preferential

and civilian employees of the Metropolitan
Police Department of the City of St. Louis be
required to reside within the City of St. Louis
just like other City employees?”; and

WHEREAS, in April, 1995, the citizens
of the City of St. Louis, who pay the salaries

loud voice in favor of the residency rule by
voting in favor of the proposition; and

WHEREAS, the residency rule in the
City of St. Louis has been part of the City
Charter since 1914 and it’s validity has
withstood every court challenge; and

from the voting majority in this City

found in House Bill 133, which was pre-filed

should be allowed to determine the rules and

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we call upon the
Missouri State Senate and the Missouri House
of Representatives to respect the will of the
majority of the residents of this city in regard
to the issue of residency for city employees
and to further refrain from taking any action
which is contrary to the express provisions
of our city charter or the authority of the
Board of Police Commissioners to establish
rules regarding the members of the St. Louis
Police Department and we further call for a
popular vote on a new non-binding resolution
for the purpose of providing the opportunity
