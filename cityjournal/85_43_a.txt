for this board to obtain as much fact-based
information regarding the effects of smoking
as is available; and
WHEREAS , it would be a great
advantage to our deliberations to know the
effect of the second hand smoke being
generated by the travelers who make use of
the smoking permitted enclosures at the
airport; and
WHEREAS, appropriate testing of the
air quality and its effects in the terminal area
near these enclosures by the air pollution
control division of the City Health
Department would provide valuable evidence
of potentially dangerous toxins in the airport
environment caused by individuals who are
smoking tobacco or provide evidence that the
smoking permitted enclosures are sufficient
and there is no need to include the airport
terminal building in the provisions of Board
Bill # 194;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we request that the
Health Commissioner authorize and direct the
air pollution control division to conduct
appropriate testing of the air quality and its
effects in the terminal building at Lambert-St.

Louis International Airport, particularly in the
area near the smoking permitted enclosures
and to report to this board any findings related
to the presence of potentially dangerous toxins
in the airport environment caused by
individuals who are smoking tobacco.
