part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining
to the opening of bids, codified as Section
5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of
St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the
same subject matter which allows a local bidder
to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
containing severability clause.

higher administrative costs of doing business
in the City;

desires to encourage businesses to remain in
the City and to relocate to the City;

WHEREAS, by enacting a local
preference law that allows a local firm to match

encourage and stimulate local business.

ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION ONE. Section One, part

presence of such bidders as desire to be
present, and shall be open to the inspection
of bidders.
B. The bids shall not be materially

or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,
after opening except when the lowest bid is
from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder
within two percent of the lowest bid may
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner
may select the bid from the local bidder. If
more than one local bidder is within two

year, and is current in payment of local taxes.

employees, chief officer, and managers of the
business regularly work and conduct business,
or where the plant or office and equipment

City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of

articles advertised for, but there shall be a
specific bid on each article. The award may be

to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition
or any part thereof, but the Board of
Standardization may reject any or all bids or
any part of any bid.

The provisions of this section are
severable. If any provision of this ordinance
