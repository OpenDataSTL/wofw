FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS
Mr. Bauer introduced Resolution
No. 276 and moved that it be assigned to the
committee on Intergovernmental Affairs for
hearing.
WHEREAS, refund anticipation loans
(RALs) and associated fees cost consumers
well over a billion dollars in 2003; and
WHEREAS, increasing numbers of
families claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit
lose some portion of their credit to high cost
of refund anticipation loans every year; and
WHEREAS, refund anticipation loans
siphon large sums from the tax refunds of St.
Louis taxpayers, especially low and moderate
income households which can least afford to
lose these dollars; and
WHEREAS, the annual percentage rates
(APRs) on these loans typically range from
97% to more than 200%; and
WHEREAS, these products result in
families being charged hundreds of dollars to
have their income taxes prepared and receive
their refunds 8 to 10 days faster than they
otherwise would; and
WHEREAS, these are dollars lost to St.
Louis families and to the economy of our city;
and
WHEREAS, these products are
aggressively marketed to lower income
neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, there is documented
evidence of major sellers of refund anticipation
loans repeatedly misleading taxpayers about
the existence of cheaper alternatives to such
loans and failing to inform taxpayers about
the option of electronic filing without a loan;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we call upon the
Attorney General for the State of Missouri
and the to carefully scrutinize tax preparers
conduct in connection with refund anticipation
loans and to take appropriate action to ensure

that their conduct is consistent with state law
and with accepted fair and ethical business
practices and we further support every effort
to protect our citizens from losing their tax
refunds dollars to overpriced loans and from
misleading and false information regarding their
tax preparation options.
Introduced the 5th day of March, 2004 by:
Honorable James F. Shrewsbury, President
Ms. Smith introduced Resolution
No. 278 and requested that it be assigned to
the Committee on Public Safety for hearing.
WHEREAS, in recent weeks there have
been reports that, in an effort to reduce
expenditures, the City of St. Louis will no
longer supply automobiles to some city
employees who travel as part of their official
duties; and
WHEREAS , employees of the
Department of Public Safety, in particular,
are dependent on city vehicles to carry out
the responsibilities of their employment; and
WHEREAS , without the availability of
city vehicles, buildings and structures will not
be inspected, nuisance properties will be
harder to identify and official documents will
not be properly served and delivered; and

WHEREAS , requiring building
inspectors and city marshals to use their own
vehicles will result in unnecessary vehicle and
employment liability issues as well as a
concern for the public safety of these
individuals who are often required to perform
their duties in less than perfect environments;
and
WHEREAS, It is within the purvey of
the Board of Aldermen to investigate the
ramifications of any proposed reduction in
the use of city-owned vehicles by city
employees and to make recommendations that
are both fiscally sound and protective of our
employees and citizens;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we direct the
Committee on Public Safety to conduct a
hearing for the purpose of determining the
extent of the proposed reduction in cityowned vehicles and to further inquire as to
any liability issues or safety concerns which
may ensue as a result of such reduction and to
further provide this Board with a report as to
it’s findings and we authorize this Committee
to exercise the power of subpoena in order
compel the production of document and
testimony as needed.
