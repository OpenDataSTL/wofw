WHEREAS, St. Louis Connecting and
Assisting Neighborhoods (a social service

matured into a pilot program at the Walbridge

School, at 5019 Alcott, adopting prevention
and intervention approaches against juveniles’
use of drugs and dangerous substances,
establishing neighborhood and family support

young adults to achieve their greatest

WHEREAS, in 1989 after several
meetings and numerous discussions, a pilot
program was implemented at the Walbridge
School to implement prevention and

this concept; and
