ELDER TIMOTHY D. PERSON
WHEREAS, Timothy David Person

and Thelma Beach Person on March 18, 1930.
He was the first born of seven; his siblings
were: Josiah (deceased), William, Mary Ann,
Thelma, Thomas, and Philip; and

WHEREAS, he was baptized at age 15
into the Faith Church of God and Saints of
Christ by his father. Tim always enjoyed
singing and participating in church; and
WHEREAS, Tim was drafted into the

U.S. Army and served as a medic in the Korean
War. Upon his discharge, he married “the love
of his life,” Mildred McClelland. They became
the proud parents of three wonderful children:
Timothy, Jr., Michael and Juanita; and
WHEREAS, he was employed as a
draftsman at Aeronautical Chart Corporation
and also McDonald Aircraft Corporation.
With his interest in science and his love of
adventure, Tim convinced his brother William

prospecting for uranium. After a considerable
amount of time in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
listening for and not hearing the “right” clicks
from their Geiger Counter, they returned to
St. Louis; and
WHEREAS, in 1953 upon returning
home to St. Louis, Tim had a renewed interest
in the family business, “Persons Moving
Service,” which was located on St. Louis
Avenue and Newstead in the Fourth Ward until

Lines, Inc., and imparted on a 17 year fight.
In February 1980, with the help of
Congressman William “Bill” Clay and others,
the Federal Government awarded Allstates
nationwide authority to provide moving
service throughout the United States. This
was the first time this has been done for any
company in the 76 year history of the federal
agency that awarded permits; and
WHEREAS, Timothy had four great
loves: his family, the church, the family
company and bowling; and
WHEREAS, he was preceded in death
by his beloved wife, Mildred who passed
away on January 18, 2015. He is survived by
his children: Timothy Person, Jr., Michael
Person, Juanita Person Williams (Dennis) and
his loving grandchildren: Timothy Person III,
Lewis Davis, Candice Roberts, Michael
Person, Jr., Anthony Roberts (Ashley), Felicia
Person, Dennis Williams, Lauren Person, and
Davita Polk and his only great grandchild,
Gabriel. He will be missed by his extended

Jackson celebrated his glorious 100th birthday;
and

WHEREAS, Mr. William Anderson
Jackson was born Wednesday, April 7th, 1915
in Greenville, Illinois to Oscar Jackson and
Sadie Mayfield. He was the eighth child of
nine (6 boys and 3 girls). Mr. Jackson attended
grade school at Lincoln School in Collinsville,
Illinois; and

WHEREAS, he was very dependable
child. He never went to high school, but
instead he sent his sister to high school, so he
could work. One of his chores was to make
sure that his family had enough coal to burn
to make fire to cook with and keep them warm
when it was cold. He and his siblings slept on
the floor around the stove because they didn’t
have a bed to sleep in. At an early age, he
made up his mind that when he grew older he
would always work and supply the needs of
his family; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Jackson and his
brother walked to St. Louis, Missouri from
Collinsville. He got a job paying $1.00 a day
working at a junkyard. Mr. Jackson was

drafted into the United States Army 1942 and
was Honorably Discharged in 1946; and

WHEREAS, he is a World War II
Veteran. One day while on furlough in St.
Louis, he won $300.00 and didn’t have anyone
to leave it with. Then he met Mary Frances
Fulks; and in talking, asked her if she would
keep the money until he came back home from
his tour of duty. When they met again, upon
his return, she apologized for spending $5.00
of his money. He was surprised that was all
she spent and because he felt that he could
trust her, that’s when he told her “I’m going
to marry you”. They were wed on April 6,
1949; and

WHEREAS, after the Army, Mr.
Jackson became a Third Degree Mason. Mr.
Jackson worked various jobs as a laborer, and
always worked two jobs to make ends meet.
He was a dishwasher at St. Marks Elementary
School and left there to his second job at the
post office. He retired from the United States
Postal Service and even after that retirement,
worked in maintenance at Cathedral
Elementary School until he fully retired in the
mid-1980s. He has always been a great
provider for his family. Even now, if he has it,
he’ll give it. Mr. Jackson enjoyed matrimony
with Mary Frances Jackson for a total of 46
years until her passing on June 1, 1995; and

WHEREAS, he really misses his wife
and adores her picture daily. He is a proud
father of 5 children, 11 grandchildren, 22 greatgrandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.
He is the epitome of life, love, wisdom, and
encouragement. When Mr. Jackson is asked
how are you doing, he says, “I ain’t going to
complain, it could get worse.” He loves to
read his Bible, read newspapers and magazines,
eat his favorite foods, talk about the old days,
share a lot of history, listen to Christian music,
and watch television especially Christian
programming, the news and wrestling. Mr.
Jackson is cool, calm and collected. He doesn’t
allow anything to worry him. Mr. Jackson
Loves the Lord and always talks about praying
for his family. Mr. Jackson is very thankful
that God has brought him through to where
he is now.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Mr. William
Anderson Jackson on the occasion of his

is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new
provision on the same subject matter;
