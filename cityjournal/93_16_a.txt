Resolution No. 135

Johnnie E. Owens
WHEREAS, Johnnie E. Owens started
working closely in the community around
1998, being ever so faithful at that time, to
attend community meetings, to keep
interested neighborhood residents informed;
and

WHEREAS, she then took an active role
in the year 2000 with Neighbors In Action.
The group dealt with community concerns
and green space issues. It was associated at
that time, with the first solar house in the
community called the Seeds of Change
Community Center at 3238 N. 20th Street,
where the meetings were held, with those
residents in attendance from Monroe and N.
Market Street, up to North 20th Street; and

WHEREAS, with the establishment of
the Hebert Street Community Garden in 2000,
by the Michael and Sandra Moser family, who
lived on Hebert Street, Johnnie became the
leader of this garden around 2002, when the
family moved. She has since helped to develop
it into the award winning garden that it is today.
She became a board member in 2003, as she
worked down through the years with the
beautification efforts of the Green Space
Committee; and

WHEREAS, as a Old North St. Louis
history book started being written by the

History Committee in 2002, the Hebert Garden
was continually being designed, as she
participated on this committee. Since the
beginning of time, gardens have always been a
part of foundations and history. So it is with
the Hebert Garden that she has touched, as it
represents a New Beginning, that others might
now enjoy the beauty, and in the months and
years ahead; and

WHEREAS, her thoughts for the
betterment of the whole area of Old North St.
Louis is to be commended; and

WHEREAS, her daily “constitutional”
walks around the neighborhood have provided
guidance to the area like an officer on the beat,
taking the littlest details and biggest problems

in her stride. Her many years of care and
concern for people and places around her mean
that Johnnie’s block is the nicest place to live,
a place which reflects her own sense of what
is right with the world; and
WHEREAS, Johnnie, it seems, rarely
thinks about herself, she is always doing
something for everyone else, and the
neighborhood. She is always working for the
betterment of Hebert Street.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the many
contributions of Johnnie E. Owens to the St.

Resolution No. 138
OPPOSITION TO
STATE OF MISSOURI REQUIRING
ST. LOUIS METROPOLITAN POLICE
DEPARTMENT TO CHECK
IMMIGRATION STATUS OF THOSE
SUSPECTED OF BEING ILLEGAL
ALIENS.
WHEREAS, the security of the United
States — including border states like Arizona
— is a pre-eminent national mandate; and
WHEREAS, immigrants bring a richness
to our country, not extant anywhere else in
the world to the same extent; and
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis has
greatly benefited from immigrants and refugees
who have played a major role in the history of
our great City, and who include people today
from throughout the globe, including Eastern
Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, who
contribute to the cosmopolitan vitality and
enrichment of our City and who assist in the
growth and stabilization of our economy and
our neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. has a national
culture of openness, embracing diversity, and
is frequently referred to as “a nation of
immigrants” and a cultural “melting pot”; and
WHEREAS, despite our cultural
celebration of difference, our U.S. historical
record is replete with what in hindsight were
major flaws. Among these were the treatment
of indigenous Native Americans by the first
European immigrants; enslavement of
Africans; runaway Manifest Destiny,
particularly in the southwestern part of our
country; treatment of dark skinned southern
Europeans; discrimination against, Italians,
Irish, Jews and Catholics; and Japanese
internment during World War II; and
WHEREAS, nevertheless the U.S.
remains a beacon of hope for many immigrants
and refugees, who are seeking the “American
Dream” of a better form of life; and
WHEREAS, because of economic and
political strife along our southern border in
Mexico — Machiladoras (where workers in
sweat shops earn poverty wages, live in
cardboard boxes, and raw sewage drains down
the dusty/muddy streets), drug lords outgun
law enforcement and the Mexican military,
and political corruption — there are
tremendous pressures (“the push”) to seek a
better life; and

WHEREAS, in addition to “the push”
of disgusting living conditions, there is “the
pull” of a draconian federal immigration system
that does not seem at times to respect the
laws of nature to preserve family unity and
the natural order of life decisions, with
virtually interminable, long waiting lines up
to 15 years or more for visas to legally entering
immigrants who overstay their permitted visa
stays in order to legally remain in the U.S.
with their citizen sons and daughters rather
than facing an uncertain future by returning to
their home countries. This same federal
immigration system encourages folks to
remain illegally in the U.S. rather than
returning home to wait for a visa for up to 15
years or more, by seemingly preferring the
skilled and well-educated over what is touted
on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired,
your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to
breathe free, The wretched refuse of your
teeming shore....”; and

WHEREAS, we are living in a time of
two competing goals: 1) Long-term —
gaining a competitive advantage in a global
economy with a population that reflects a
global village; and 2) Short-term — protecting
the native born workforce in a time of recession
and unemployment; and

WHEREAS, southern border states
such as Arizona have tremendous illegal
immigration problems that are not being
addressed by federal immigration laws,
national security enhancements, or
improvements in the way of life in Mexico;
Arizona has chosen therefore, to address
matters in a helter skelter, state-by-state basis,
rather than according to a more rational federal
manner; and

WHEREAS, the desperate efforts of
Arizona to stem the tide of illegal immigration
has resulted in what many view as the
enactment of legislation (S.B. 1070) that will
likely lead to racial profiling, discrimination
based on national origin, and denial of the U.S.
Constitution’s 14th Amendment guarantees
of due process and equal protection; and

WHEREAS, in the last Missouri
legislative session there were rumblings that
some legislators would like to succomb to the
short-term desire to demogogue the issue of
immigration in an environment of xenophobic
anti-immigrant hysteria, rather than rationally
protecting the constitutional rights guaranteed
to all in a way that furthers the interests of all
Americans to a globally competitive economy;
and

WHEREAS, to make matters worse,
Missouri does not seem to have an illegal alien
problem like border states, so there are
absolutely no real benefits to be realized by

legislation that risks denial of U.S.
Constitutional rights, discrimination, and harm
to our local economy; and

WHEREAS, unlike any other place on
this planet, the two largest population centers
in Missouri (with the largest number of legal
immigrants, refugees, persons of color and
“minority populations”) have police
departments that are controlled by a police
board that is selected by the governor, not
locally controlled by the residents of the city
of St. Louis or Kansas City, but are funded by
the taxpayers of these cities — not funded
by the State of Missouri that controls them;

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis has
major crime issues, and immigration
enforcement, which is a federal obligation,
would siphon and misdirect precious
resources rather than focusing on real crimes
and criminals. If the State of Missouri were
to enact legislation similar to Arizona’s law,
which requires law enforcement to detain
person who have not committed crimes, but
who may be illegal aliens, this would be an
unfunded mandate in violation of the Missouri
Constitution, Article X, Sections 16-24
(commonly referred to as the “Hancock
Amendment”), and more specifically sections
16 and 21 of the Hancock Amendment; and
WHEREAS, Immigration enforcement
diverts resources from preserving, protecting
and defending the people of St. Louis from
solving crime and chasing criminals, and
instead wastes money on a problems that
doesn’t exist, by targeting people and areas,
based on national origin, skin color and
language; and
WHEREAS, St. Louis Metropolitan
Police Department personnel are not trained
as border patrol agents or Immigration &
Custom Enforcement (ICE) officers, and the
problem to the extent it exists is more
effectively addressed through employment
verification measures (I-9 forms) and E-Verify
(a federal computer data system, designed to
determine employment eligibility), border
patrols, and a federal comprehensive overhaul
of the immigration system; and
WHEREAS, good local law enforcement
requires that the local police engender the trust
and confidence of all residents in the
community, including non-citizens, those who
speak English as a second language, and those
from many countries and backgrounds.
Enforcement of laws that target these groups
smacks of racial superiority and drives a
wedged between the public and law
enforcement; and
WHEREAS, focusing on particular
areas where persons of Latino descent frequent

in order to question persons who might
“appear” Latino about their legal status in this
country would have a chilling effect on
commerce, because even the vast majority who
are here in legal status would avoid the hassle
of being questioned by avoiding the
checkpoints, thus negatively impacting
commerce.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT BY THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF THE CITY
OF ST. LOUIS, that we go on record as
opposing any law which purports to require
local law enforcement officers of the St. Louis
Metropolitan Police Department to enforce
immigration laws by questioning or detaining
anyone whom they believe to be
undocumented aliens, whether or not they are
suspected of having committed a crime. We
direct the Clerk of the Board of Aldermen to
spread a copy of this resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and we further
direct the Clerk of the Board of Aldermen to
mail copies of this resolution (in reduced
format) to members of the State of Missouri
Legislature and Governor Jeremiah “Jay”
Nixon, as directed by the sponsors.

Carried unanimously by voice vote.

Mr. Schmid introduced Resolution No.
129 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 129
RESOLUTION FOR UNIVERSAL
ACCESS TO PUBLIC,
EDUCATIONAL& GOVERNMENT
CHANNELS AND SUPPORT OF
H.R. 3745
WHEREAS, On June 8, 2010, Charter
Communications, Inc. transferred STL-TV (St.
Louis government), SLPS-TV (St. Louis Public
Schools), HEC-TV (higher education),
KDHX (Double Helix Public Programming),
and C-Span2 to digital channels on the 980998 public affairs neighborhood. At the same
time EWTN-TV (Catholic Programming), and
the weather and channel selections channels
were all moved from easy accessibility by
Basic Tier Cable users; and
WHEREAS, Public, Educational, and
Governmental (PEG) Programming Channels
play a significant informative, educational and
participatory role in our democracy and in
the City of St. Louis; and
WHEREAS, “Information is as vital to
the healthy functioning of communities as
clean air, safe streets, good schools and public
health”, according to the Knight Commission
Report, On the Information Needs of
Communities in a Democracy, December
2009); and
WHEREAS, the movement of these
PEG channels limits public access by placing
an unnecessary barrier to access, whose only
apparent
purpose
is
Charter
Communication’s profit — and even that could
backfire, if customers leave them. Charter’s
customers are blocked from accessing these
PEG channels unless they purchase monthly
digital box services or buy a digital television;
and
WHEREAS, it is critical to a wellinformed and participatory democracy that
we assure equal access to PEG channels and
preserve service provider funding for PEG
channels, so that these channels continue to
be available to the entire community and to
serve the residents of the City of St. Louis in
the manner in which they have become
accustomed; and
WHEREAS, there is currently pending
before Congress H.R. 3745, which would
establish the Community Access Preservation
(CAP) Act; and
WHEREAS, the CAP Act would amend
the Communications Act of 1934 to provide
for carriage and display of PEG channels
without additional charges, and via channels
whose quality, accessibility, functionality and
placement is consistent with commercial
channels; and
WHEREAS, the CAP Act would

preserve PEG channels and the much needed
funding for PEG facilities and operations, and
ensure that the channels continue to be
available to the entire community; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act would
provide important solutions for critical and
immediate financial needs of PEG channels
and facilities by unrestricting the use of PEG
franchise fees for any PEG related purpose;
and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act would require
the Federal Communications Commission to
submit a report to Congress relative to the
impact of state video service franchising laws
on PEG cable systems and channels since
2005; and

WHEREAS, in states that have enacted
state level franchising laws since May 31,
2005, the CAP Act would require each cable
operator to continue to provide financial and
infrastructure support and channel capacity
based on the support historically provided
by the cable operator; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act ensures
technological neutrality by applying PEG
requirements to all landline video service
providers, regardless of the transmission
protocol.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT BY THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF THE CITY
OF ST. LOUIS, that we pause in our
deliberations to support H.R. 3745, which
would establish the Community Access
Preservation (CAP) Act and amend the
Communications Act of 1934 to provide for
carriage and display of public, educational,
and governmental (PEG) channels in a manner
consistent with commercial channels. We
further urge our U.S. Congressional Delegation
to take all possible actions in support of the
passage of H.R. 3745, including but not limited
to endorsing, co-sponsoring, working for
rapid passage, and voting for H.R. 3745. We
further direct the Clerk of this Board to prepare
a copy of this Resolution and mail it to each
member of our U.S. Congressional Delegation:
Senator Christopher “Kit” Bond, Senator
Claire McCaskill, Representative William
“Lacy” Clay and Representative Russ
Carnahan.
