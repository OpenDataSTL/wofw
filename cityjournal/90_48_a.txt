COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 334, 335, 336 and 337 and the clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 334
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
on February 9, 2008, the famous Mr. Wynton
Marsalis performed in the City of St. Louis;
and
WHEREAS, Mr. Marsalis has been
described as the most outstanding jazz
musician and trumpeter of his generation, as
one of the world’s top classical trumpeters,
as a big band leader in the tradition of Duke
Ellington, a brilliant composer, a devoted
advocate for the Arts and a tireless and
inspiring educator. He carries these
distinctions well. His life is a portrait of
discipline, dedication, sacrifice, and creative
accomplishment; and
WHEREAS, the sound of Mr. Marsalis’
band is inspired by the basic principals of
democracy. According to Mr. Marsalis, what
you hear in a great jazz band is the sound of
democracy. “The jazz band works best when
participation is shaped by intelligent
communication;” and
WHEREAS, Mr. Marsalis has won nine
of the coveted Grammy Awards, earned the
distinction of being the only artist ever to win
Grammy Awards for both jazz and classical
records (an accomplishment he astonishingly
repeated in consecutive years), and he is the
only artist ever to have won Grammy Awards
in five consecutive years; and
WHEREAS, in the spring of 2001
United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan
proclaimed Wynton Marsalis an international
ambassador of goodwill by appointing him a
U N Messenger of Peace; and
WHEREAS, to date, Mr. Marsalis has
produced 33 jazz and 11 classical records and
has sold over 7 million records worldwide
including 3 Gold Records. With his collection
of standards, he reinvigorated the jazz

musician’s relationship to the American
popular song; and

WHEREAS, from My Sister’s Place (a
shelter for battered women) to Graham
Windham (a shelter for homeless children),
the Children’s Defense Fund, Amnesty
International, the Sloan Kettering Cancer
Institute, Food For All Seasons (a food bank
for the elderly and disadvantaged), Very
Special Arts (an organization that provides
experiences in dance, drama, literature, and
music for individuals with physical and mental
disabilities) to the Newark Boys Chorus
School ( a full-time academic music school for
disadvantaged youths) and many, many more
organizations, Mr. Marsalis has responded
enthusiastically to the call for service. It is
Mr. Marsalis’ commitment to the
improvement of life for all people, as well as
his outstanding contributions to the Arts, that
portray the best of his character and humanity.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate Mr. Wynton
Marsalis on the occasion of his most recent
St. Louis performance and we wish him
continued success, accomplishment and
achievement and we further direct the Clerk
of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative

Resolution No. 335

WHEREAS, we pause in our
deliberations to note the untimely passing of
longtime St. Louis resident, Arthur Lee; and

WHEREAS, Arthur Lee was born on
April 2, 1914 in Bernard, Mississippi to the
union of Handy and Bernice Lee. He accepted
Christ as his personal Savior at a very young
age and was baptized. He attended school in
the state of Mississippi; and

WHEREAS, on October 19, 1933,
Arthur was united in holy matrimony with
Almetter Colenbery, in Clarksdale,
Mississippi. To this union five sons were
born; and

WHEREAS, in December of 1934, the
Lee family relocated to St. Louis and was
immediately united in Christian fellowship
with New Bethlehem Missionary Baptist
Church, under the leadership of Pastor S.L.

Love. After the death of Pastor Love, Deacon
Lee remained a faithful member of the New
Bethlehem Missionary Baptist church under
the Pastorate of Pastor Phelton Wednesday
Jones. Under the leadership of Pastor P.W.
Jones, Deacon Lee was appointed a Sunday
School Teacher and Directory of the Baptist
Training Union, where he served untiringly.
During earlier years, as a young man, he was a
faithful member of the Golden Echo Male
Chorus, a community choral group from
various churches whose music ministry was a
blessing to many people as they sang Zion
songs in many churches throughout the St.
Louis area; and
WHEREAS, on October 24, 1975 after
the death of Pastor P.W. Jones, Pastor Hosea’
E. Gales was elected pastor of the New
Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church.
Pastor Gales retained Deacon Lee in every
position he had served in over the years.
Deacon Lee, in turn, remained faithful until
declined health prevented him from serving as
he once did. Deacon Lee was very well read in
the word of God and could always point you
to the Scriptures for whatever one might be
experiencing. He also touched the lives and
spirits of many when called upon to lead the
church in the singing of a Dr. Isaac Watts hymn
or Prayer of Faith; and
WHEREAS, on Wednesday, January 30,
2008 our Lord relieved him from all earthly
sorrows and ills, by way of divine transition.
“Cares all past, home at last, evermore to
rejoice!;” and
WHEREAS, Deacon Arthur Lee is
survived by his sons; Sidney, Sterling of
Houston, Texas, Arthur, Jr., Calvin Jesse of
Minneapolis, Minnesota and Tommie; one
adopted daughter, Rochelle; seven
grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, other
relatives and friends.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
remember the many contributions of Arthur
Lee to the citizens of the City of St. Louis and
we join with his many friends in expressing
our sorrow at his passing, and we further direct
the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of
this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a memorial copy
for presentation to the Lee family, at a time
and place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
