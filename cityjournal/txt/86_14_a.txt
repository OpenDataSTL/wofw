FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS

Resolution No. 85

WHEREAS, the United States House
of Representatives is currently considering
legislation which will greatly increase the

number of American workers who will be
exempt from the federally mandated overtime
pay and minimum wage rules enforced under
the Federal Labor Standards Act (FLSA); and
WHEREAS , if this legislation is enacted
by Congress, hundreds of thousands of
workers in this country will be reclassified by
their employers and will no longer be eligible
for overtime pay; instead they will be offered
unpaid compensatory time off at a time to be
designated by the employer; and
WHEREAS, Missouri Congressman
Richard A. Gephardt recently wrote to Labor
Secretary Elaine Chao stating that the
proposal would unfairly deny overtime
benefits to American workers and would allow
employers to make employees work longer
for less pay; and
WHEREAS, this legislative effort, which
is supported by the Bush Administration,
would undo decades of progress in this country
to guarantee that every worker would receive
a “fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work”; and
WHEREAS, the right of the employee
to determine how they should be compensated
for overtime work should be preserved and
must be protected;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we join with
Congressman Richard A. Gephardt and the
many members of the House of
Representatives who are opposed to any
change in the federal overtime pay and
minimum wage rules and we further join with
them in calling for the current legislation to be
withdrawn by the Bush Administration in
order to protect the rights of the workers in
this country.

Attorney’s vehicles be supplied with State of
Missouri license plates; and
WHEREAS, the justification for such
request is that the Circuit Attorney need
unmarked vehicles to be used in covert
operations in support of the Gang Unit and
to safely transport witnesses; and
WHEREAS, this request was been
approved by the Board of Estimate and
Apportionment on June 18, 2003; and
WHEREAS, this Board of Aldermen
recognizes the need for an unmarked stateplated vehicle for the Office of the Circuit
Attorney;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED that this Board of Aldermen,
meeting in regular session and being apprised
of the foregoing, does hereby approve the
procurement and use of two sets of state
license plates for the Office of the Circuit
Attorney.
Introduced this the 27th day of June 2003 by:
Honorable Stephen Conway, Alderman 8th Ward
Unanimous consent having been
obtained Resolution No. 86 stood considered.
Mr. Conway moved that Resolution
No. 86 be adopted, at this meeting of the
Board.
Seconded by Mr. Ortmann.
Carried unanimously by voice vote.
Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.
87 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 87
WHEREAS, under the provisions of
Ordinance 65433 the City of St. Louis renewed
the cable franchise held by Charter
Communications, Inc.; and
WHEREAS, as part of the franchise
agreement, Charter Communications agreed to
comply with certain terms and conditions
intended to improve cable services and increase
the economic benefit to the City; and
WHEREAS, these terms and conditions
included goals related to Minority and Women
Business Enterprise participation in the
professional services and construction
contracts for work related to the upgrading of
the cable system in this city; and

WHEREAS , according to recent cable
franchise reports required by the cable
franchise ordinance, to date, both these goals
have not been met and in fact are not more
than 5 percent combined which is grossly
below anticipated goals as it relates to the
cable system upgrade construction; and

WHEREAS, this failure to include the
participation of minorities and women, as
required by Ordinance 65433, calls into
question Charter Communications’
compliance with other terms and conditions
of their franchise agreement; and

WHEREAS, it is within the purview of
the Public Utilities Committee to review and
comment on the compliance of Charter
Communications with the terms and
conditions of Ordinance 65433 and to further
review Charter’s progress in improving the
cable system in the City of St. Louis;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we direct the Public
Utilities Committee to review the compliance
of Charter Communications with the terms
and conditions of Ordinance 65433 and
Charter’s progress in improving the cable
system in the City of St. Louis and we further
strongly suggest that the Communications
Division stop the issuance of any permits or
approvals under it’s authority related to the
cable upgrade and that Charter
Communications halt the awarding of
contracts for the cable system upgrade until
they are in compliance with the terms and
conditions of Ordinance 65433 with respect
to such upgrade.

Resolution No. 100
RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF
ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF
ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI ORDERING
AND SETTING CABLE TELEVISION
RATES FOR BASIC SERVICE AND
EQUIPMENT PURSUANT TO FCC
FORMS 1240 AND 1205 DATED
SEPTEMBER 30, 2002
Community Unit
Identification # MO0545
WHEREAS
1. Section 623 of the Cable Communications
Policy Act of 1984, 47 U.S.C. §543, as
amended by the Cable Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992 (“Cable Act”),
allows Local Franchise Authorities to regulate
certain cable television rates in accordance with
rules and procedures established by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC);
and
2. The Board of Aldermen of the City of
St. Louis, Missouri (“City”), is the Franchise
Authority under the City Charter, is
empowered by Ordinance to consider and
decide cable-related issues, has adopted on
June 11, 1993 Board Resolution #47
authorizing its Petition for Certification and
Local Rules for Rate Regulation, and is duly
certified by the FCC to regulate certain rates
including those for the Basic Service Tier
(BST); monthly equipment rentals, the hourly
service charge (HSC) and installation fees based
on the HSC included in the Form 1205
(“equipment rates”); and
3. The Communications Division holds
duties delegated by the Board of Aldermen as
its Franchise Agency with respect to cable
matters under Cable Regulatory Ordinance
65431, Section Thirty-Two, and the Agency
is required under Local Rules to submit a
report and recommendation on rate proposals
to the Board; and
4.
Charter Communications Entertainment
I, LLC, doing business as Charter
Communications (“Charter”) and franchised
to operate a cable system in the City of St.
Louis in accordance with terms of a transfer
of ownership from AT&T Broadband on June
30, 2001 and its franchise renewal agreement
with the City of St. Louis effective May 23,
2002, has submitted a rate filing dated
September 30, 2002 (The “Rate Filing”); and

5.
This filing - FCC Form 1240, “Updating
Maximum Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable
Services,” with its associated FCC Form 1205,
“Determining Regulated Equipment and
Installation Costs, ‘Equipment Form,’” purports to set forth and justify increases in
the maximum permitted rates Charter may
charge City subscribers for basic cable service,
hourly service charges (HSC), equipment
rental, and other activities ( including some
but not other various types of installations,
re-connections and changes in service); and
6. FCC rules require that the cable operator
follow the FCC’s rules and instructions with
regards to preparation of the forms, separately
listing and calculating the hours and costs for
each activity for which the Operator wants
to charge a separate rate, including a rate for
“basic-Only” converters, and and presenting
adequate support and documentation to
justify the Operator’s proposed Maximum
Permitted Rates ; and
7. The Franchise Agency, having identified
certain problems, omissions, and
discrepancies in the Forms 1240 and 1205
and supporting documentation as filed by
Charter, sought legal and technical assistance
in reviewing and analyzing both Forms; and

8.
FCC rules allow the Local Franchise
Authority (LFA) to: seek additional
information and supporting documentation;
evaluate the correctness and reasonableness
of those submissions; seek and use the most
reliable data available; adjust rate calculations
with the most currently available figures; and
- in the context of the best information
available - act reasonably when setting
maximum permitted rates different from those
calculated by the Operator; and
9. The Agency has actively sought
additional information from Charter regarding
the basis for its rate calculations proposals
and afforded Charter ample opportunity to
respond to three formal written “Requests
For Information”. Charter’s responses have,
among other things, provided incomplete
support, submitted inconsistent figures,
double-counted certain costs, declined to
verify the exact amounts of reductions in
franchise-related costs, not responded at all,
and/or otherwise failed to justify the maximum
permitted rates it proposes; and
10. In 1996, the City had accepted March
1st as the date for annual rate filings. In 2002
Charter, without notice to the City as required
in FCC 47 C.F.R. 76.922(e)(1), changed the
date of the filing to September 30th, a date
which effectively reduces the City’s timeframe for review and action from a full 12
months to only 10 months, due to the annual
summer recess of the Board of Aldermen from
mid-July to mid-September.

11. Charter Communications and the public
have been afforded opportunity to comment
on the contents of a draft rate order and
accompanying reports prior to its adoption;
and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
AND ORDERED THAT,

A. The Board of Aldermen of the City of St.
Louis finds that Charter, has not met its
burden of proof in supporting and justifying
its proposed Maximum Permitted Rates for
the period January 1,.2003 to December 31,
2003 based on City assessment of the
information provided and not provided by
Charter since September 30, 2002, as well as
various errors, exclusions, omissions , lack of
documentation, and other problems with
Charter methodology as described in the Staff
Report and the Consultant Report.

B. The Board of Aldermen finds the
descriptions, methodologies and calculations
in the Consultant and Staff Reports as the
best available basis for setting rates, and finds
FRC’s recalculation and recommendations for
Charter’s maximum permitted rates to be
reasonable and appropriate.

Approved Rates

C. For the period beginning January 1, 2003,
the Board of Aldermen hereby approves the
following maximum permitted rates (exclusive
of applicable franchise fees and sales taxes) in
accordance with the rates calculated and
recommended in the FRC Report as the
maximum rate that can be charged for each
item:
BASIC SERVICE RATE – FORM 1240

Operator Selected Rate (“OSR”) of
$11.21 (including FCC fee) as implemented
by Charter, based on FRC’s calculation of a
Maximum Permitted Rate of $11.23 (including
FCC fee). Note: On cable bills, Charter
separates the $11.21 into $11.16 for Basic
Service and $0.05 for FCC Regulatory Fee.
EQUIPMENT RATES – FORM 1205
Equipment Rentals
- Analog converter – basic only
$0.52
-Analog or digital converter (all others) 3.85

subscribers as required by FCC rules.

D. The City recognizes that under federal
rules, Charter is allowed to impose separate
charges for such installations if Charter
chooses to include them in Form 1205s (along
with necessary supporting information). Such
inclusion would allow the City to review and
determine the appropriate Maximum
Permitted Rate pursuant to federal rules.
Charter’s Rate Filing did not propose separate
charges for the types of installations or service

changes listed, therefore Maximum Permitted
Rates of zero for these items are ordered. As
a result, for the rate period beginning
January 1, 2003 Charter is not permitted to
charge for these items and must refund any
monies collected for these activities, until the
first lawful date subsequent to filing of the
next valid Form 1205.
E. The rates set herein are subject to further
reduction and refund (to the extent permitted
under applicable law and regulations as the
same may be amended from time to time).

Implementation of
Rates and Charges
F. Charter shall not charge any rate higher
than the rate set herein, nor increase that rate,
nor impose on subscribers any other charge
for basic service or equipment not specified
herein or in the City’s previous rate orders,
including but not limited to bulk and
commercial rates (to the extent such limitation
is permitted by applicable law), unless such
charge is first filed with and approved by the
City, in accordance with applicable law and
regulations, including but not limited to the
notice requirements imposed by 47 C.F.R.
§76.932, or as otherwise expressly permitted
under applicable law and regulations.
G.
Charter may charge rates less than the
maximum rate indicated above for basic service
or equipment, as long as such rates are applied
in a uniform and nondiscriminatory way,
pursuant to applicable federal, state, and local
laws and regulations.
H. Until a new rate filing is validly made in
accordance with FCC regulations and
applicable law, Charter shall not alter its OSR,
nor impose actual rates exceeding the OSR
then in effect. Further, Charter shall not raise
the rates covered by this Rate Order until
twelve months from the date of the last
increase. For example, if Charter raised an
individual rate to a selected rate below the
maximum permitted rates in June 2003,
Charter may not raise the same rate again
until June of 2004 even if the current rate is
below the maximum permitted rate.

Implementation of
Reductions and Refunds
I.
As soon as possible, but in any event
within thirty days from the effective date of
this Order, Charter shall make any rate
reductions that are necessary based on the
rates shown above.
J.
Pursuant to City’s Local Rules Section
Eight(2) , within ninety days from the date of
this Order, Charter shall file with the Agency
a certification, signed by an authorized
representative of Charter, stating whether
Charter has complied fully with all provisions
of this Order, describing in detail the precise

measures taken to implement the rates
contained in this Order.

K. Charter shall refund any amounts charged
to subscribers that exceed the maximum
permitted amounts specified herein. Refunds
shall be made in accordance with 47 C.F.R.
§76.942(d) and Section Eight of Resolution
#47, and shall include interest computed at
applicable rates published by the Internal
Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional
tax payments, pursuant to 47 C.F.R.
§76.942(e).
L.
Within thirty days of the date of this
Order,

a) Charter shall file with the Franchise Agency
materials sufficient to demonstrate its
proposed methodology for making any
refunds required herein. Such materials shall
include, without limitation,

1) a narrative explanation in detail of the
methods used to calculate all refunds, including
how the refund amount was determined and
how interest was calculated on a persubscriber basis for any refunds required by
this Order;

2) the aggregate amounts of any refunds to be
made for each affected rate, including separate
itemization of the amounts attributable to
interest; and specific examples (from which
any individual identifying information may
be redacted) of sample calculations of all
refunds for representative classes of
subscribers.

3) a description of Charter’s proposed
placement/ wording of the refund amounts/
explanations on subscriber bills, including the
maximum number of characters and spaces
available on individual bill line items and for
general messages.

b) The materials provided must be sufficient
to permit the City to verify whether Charter’s
refund plans comply with the requirements
of this Order and applicable law. If Charter
claims that no refunds are due, Charter shall
provide a complete explanation including
sample calculations as described above.

M. The City will review the material
submitted by Charter and will either approve
the refund plan as submitted or require Charter
to make corrections to the calculations and/or
methodologies used by Charter. To the extent
revisions are required by the City, Charter
will make the revisions within fourteen days
after the City’s request and re-submit the
refund calculations and plan.

N. The City shall approve in advance
Charter’s placement/wording of the refund
amount on the bill and the descriptions used
to identify the reasons for the refund amounts.

O. Within forty-five days from the date the
refund calculations and plan are approved by
the City, Charter shall begin refunding all
monies through individual bill credits to all
affected subscribers and shall issue the entire
amount of the approved refund amounts
within one billing cycle.
P.
No later than thirty days after the end
of the end of the last billing cycle where the
refunds were made, Charter shall provide to
the Agency a complete accounting of the
refunds to subscribers , stating whether
Charter has complied fully with all provisions
of this Order, describing in detail the precise
measures taken to implement this Order, and
showing how any refunds (including interest)
were calculated and distributed, and including
an attestation to the accuracy of the report by
the Chief Accounting Officer. The materials
provided must be sufficient to permit the City
to verify whether Charter’s refunds comply
with the requirements of this Order and
applicable law.
Q. Charter shall resubmit its Form 1205
within forty-five days from the date of this
Order with the corrections indicated in section
IV (E) of the FRC Report.
(a) As described in the FRC report, only the
following items are to be corrected in the resubmitted filing:
Charter will revise the asset balances for all
assets contained on Schedules A & C as a
results of the accounting restatements
announced by Charter;
Charter will include corresponding
accumulated deferred income taxes for all
assets on Schedule A & C;
To the extent the asset restatements require
modifications to other expenses like
depreciation expense, Charter shall include
these modifications;
Eliminate the “travel & entertainment”
expenses shown on Schedule B;
Eliminate from Schedule B those expenses that
are also capitalized and included on Schedule
A (see section IV (C)(3) of the FRC report);
and
Revise the balance of the remote control units
to include all units in service including the
“free” units included with purchased
converters (see section IV (C)(5) of the FRC
report).
(b) Because of the lack of any response to
date by Charter regarding these accounting
restatements, Charter must also provide with
this re-submitted filing an accounting
certifications signed by the Chief Accounting

Officer stating affirmatively that all of the
announced accounting re-statements that
could affect the Form 1205 cost data has been
included in the re-submission. The City may
require modifications to that certification to
allow the City to be fully assured that Charter
has completely complied with the intent of
this section.
(c) The City reserves all its rights to require
further supporting information, reductions and
refunds on the basis of corrected data Charter
may provide. In making this filing, Charter
shall comply with all applicable FCC rules,
both as specifically indicated in this Order
and generally. Charter shall keep a full
accounting of all subscriber charges under the
Rate Filing and this Order, so that any
necessary refunds can be provided to
subscribers as needed

Future Rate Filings
R. Charter shall return to the original
approved filing date, and therefore make its
next annual rate filing on or about
March 1, 2004, and subsequent annual rate
filings on subsequent March 1 dates, unless
and until Charter and the City otherwise agree
on a mutually acceptable date.
S. Charter shall use the Maximum
Permitted Rates set in this Order as its starting
points in carrying out the calculations in its
next rate filing.
T. Due to the unusually large number of
errors, inconsistencies, and omissions which
violate of FCC rules evident in the Rate
Filings, this order cautions Charter to adhere
to FCC regulations, instructions and any other
applicable law in making future rate filings.
U. In future rate filings, in addition to
specifying the Operator Selected Rate for the
Basic Service Tier as shown as Form 1240,
Charter shall also specify the amounts it
intends to charge during the projected period
for all applicable equipment and installation
rates outlined in Form 1205.
V. To ensure reasonable rates for
subscribers by ensuring consistency with the
2002 Form 1240 Rate Filing, Charter shall
prepare future Form 1240 rate filings on the
assumption that all subscribers are placed on
the upgraded system as soon as the upgrade
takes effect for the first subscriber (“one-form
method”) as discussed in the FRC Report at
III(F)

Other
W. The City reserves its right to apply any
applicable sanctions for Charter’s violations
of FCC regulations, the franchise agreement,
relevant city rules, and other applicable law.

X. The findings herein are based on the
representations of Charter.
Should
information come to the City’s attention that
these representations were inaccurate in any
material way, the City reserves the right to
take appropriate action. This Order is not to
be construed as a finding that the City has
accepted as correct any specific entry,
explanation or argument made by Charter not
specifically addressed herein.

Y. The City reserves all of its rights with
respect to rate regulation, including, but not
limited to, any right it may have to reopen
this rate proceeding based on new information
or rulings by governing authority, if it appears
that such new information or rulings could
alter the reasonable rates prescribed by FCC
regulations, and any right the City may have
to “true up” overcharges or undercharges in
connection with future rate filings pursuant
to 47 C.F.R. §76.922(e)(3).

Z. This Order shall be effective immediately
upon its approval by the Board of Aldermen.
The Staff Report & Recommendations is an
integral part of this Order. The rates set herein
will govern Charter’s basic service rates until
Charter lawfully implements a further rate
change pursuant to applicable FCC
regulations. This Order constitutes the written
decision required by 47 C.F.R. §76.936(a) and
shall be released to the public and to Charter,
and a public notice shall be published stating
that this Order has been issued and is available
for review, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. §76.936(b).
