Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 264

St. Louis Metropolitan Police
Department and the Missouri
Department of Corrections Board
of Probation and Parole
WHEREAS, we come now to recognize
and acknowledge the work of the Saint Louis
Metropolitan Police Department and the
Missouri Department of Corrections Board
of Probation and Parole. In June 2007, the
two aforementioned agencies created a
partnership in an effort to address the
escalating crime rates in the Wells-Goodfellow/
Kingsway West Neighborhoods. From this
collaboration a unique partnership, known as
the Saint Louis Police Partnership Project,
was developed and brought the SLMPD and
the MBPP together in an effort to reduce crime
by combining their strategies and resources to
achieve the mutual goal of improved public
safety; and

WHEREAS, the program pairs a Police
Officer and Probation and Parole Officer to
jointly provide intensive supervision and
guidance to high risk/high need individuals;
and

WHEREAS, the project began with
approximately fifteen high risk/high need
clients and has grown to carrying 40-50 at
any one time and existing in the 7th District
neighborhoods of Wells-Goodfellow,
Kingsway West, Hamilton Heights and West
End Neighborhoods. Since its inception, over
200 clients have participated in the project
with a success rate illustrated by a significant
reduction in new arrests and a lower than
average recidivism rate. These neighborhoods
were identified as having some of the highest
crime rates in the city. Since the inception of
the project, crime rates, new arrests, active
substance abuse and unemployment have
reduced significantly in the represented clients.
Also, enrollment in vocational and educational

programs has experienced a strong increase
by these same clients; and
WHEREAS, responsible for this
programs success are the men and women of
these great organizations. Yet, of the many
who have contributed special recognition goes
to Chief Daniel Isom, Captain James Moran,
Captain Doyle Dotson, Captain Joseph
Spiess, Officer Dawain Wallace and Officer
Andre Jackson of the SLMPD and Regional
Administrator Nancy McCarthy, Unit
Supervisors Anthony Davis, Cora Haynes,
Valorie Sparks and Probation and Parole
Officers Lisa Johnson and Rebecca Michels
of the MBPP. These officers have dedicated
their time to the success of every client
represented by this program and their lives to
the success of our great city; and
WHEREAS, it is for these efforts that
we the members of the St. Louis Board of
Aldermen would like to recognize the Saint
Louis Metropolitan Police Department and
its Seventh District as well as the Missouri
Department of Corrections Board of Probation
and Parole. We would like to commend them
for taking the initiative and innovative
approach to reducing crime, enhancing public
safety and improving the quality of life for
the represented clients and the WellsGoodfellow, Kingsway West, Hamilton
Heights and West End Neighborhoods.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the Saint Louis
Metropolitan Police Department and its
Seventh District as well as the Missouri
Department of Corrections Board of Probation
and Parole for their successful program and
we wish them continued success and
accomplishment and we further direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our honorees at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.
