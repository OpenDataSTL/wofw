Resolution No. 311

The Lafayette Square
Security and Safety Model
WHEREAS, the residents of Lafayette
Square have always been proactive in
maintaining a positive, thriving neighborhood
in an urban setting. Community activities,
ranging from annual house tours and a
nationally recognized bike race to movies and
concerts in beautiful Lafayette Park, have made
Lafayette Square a destination neighborhood.
As more people visit and move to the area,
the Lafayette Square community strives to
provide a safe and enjoyable environment.
However, their quality of life was threatened
in late 2009 when an increase in crime affected
residents and visitors alike; and

WHEREAS, on December 11, 2009, in
an effort to create a safer neighborhood within
the city of St. Louis, a Neighborhood Mobile
Patrol Program was initiated. The program
utilizes a combination of resident volunteers
and state-of-the-art technology, working with
and under the guidance of the St. Louis
Metropolitan Police Department. Resident
volunteers canvas the neighborhood focusing
on safety concerns and suspicious activity
that require a call to the police; and

WHEREAS, the mode developed a bond
of trust and communication with the 4th
District Police and Circuit Attorney’s Office,
keeping us abreast of any crimes that occur
and enabling us to take proactive measures

preventing future crime. They built a smart
neighborhood model that utilizes technologies,
resident volunteers, and trusted relationships
with the police department, Circuit Attorney’s
Office and judges. This model has improved
their quality of life by increasing
communication and decreasing crime. They
are currently helping surrounding
neighborhoods adopt models that work for
their demographics; and
WHEREAS, they have put up 40
surveillance camera signs informing individuals
that cameras are used in the neighborhood.
They created a secure 4th district police
substation on Park Avenue, which was St.
Louis Police Board approved. The substation
gives police easier access to the information
they require to do their jobs more efficiently
and effectively, and has resulted in an
increased police presence in the area and faster
response times; and
WHEREAS, the model hosted several
safety and neighborhood watch classes
throughout the year. Nearby neighborhoods
were invited to attend. guest speakers at the
monthly neighborhood meetings have included
the 4th district police specifically Captain
Kenneth Kegel and Officer Brian Min;
Neighborhood Watch and Mobile Patrol
Sergeant Catherine Dennis; Community
Outreach Sergeant Demetrius Elston; Gang
Unit Detective Alfonso Hayes; Chief Legal
Counsel Susan Guerra; Chief Deputy Juvenile
Officer Catherine Horejes; and Judges Jimmy
Edwards, Paula Bryant and Mike Stelzer; and

WHEREAS, five residents graduated
from the St. Louis Police Citizens Academy,
where they gained a better understanding of
the processes, procedures and daily issues of
the police as they work to serve and protect.
Three residents have submitted their
applications to attend the upcoming March
2011 class. Residents met with various judges
to understand their roles and to learn how we
can help. Tony Krawat wrote Neighborhood
Impact Statements to judges to aid in
prosecuting anyone who is caught offending
in our neighborhood. He continues to do so
when needed, although has not had to recently
because of the decrease in crime; and
WHEREAS, residents attended court
cases on individuals who committed crimes in
Lafayette Square. Three criminals are now
serving time in the Missouri Correctional
Facility because of their efforts. They
currently have six Neighborhood Order of
Protections on individuals who have
committed crimes in Lafayette Square. The
Circuit Attorney’s Office trained seven
residents for the Lafayette Square Victim
Support Group, which is led by Betty Randa.
The group reaches out to crime victims,

whether residents or visitors. The objective is
to help victims through their trauma and to
stress the importance of being a witness.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the success of the
Lafayette Square Security and Safety Model
