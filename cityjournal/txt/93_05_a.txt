50th Wedding Anniversary of
Walter and Barbara Thomas
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
on April 10, 2010 Walter and Barbara Thomas
who will celebrate their 50th Wedding
Anniversary and they will renew their vows
at the Greater Mount Carmel Baptist Church,
where the Rev. Earl E. Nance Jr. is the Pastor.
They joined Greater Mount Carmel Baptist
Church under the leadership of Rev. Earl E.
Nance, Sr. and Rev. Nance, Sr. married them;
and

WHEREAS, they are the proud parents
of four children: Walter III, Carmelita
(Anthony West), Anthony (Duana RussellThomas), Nicolya (Johnson) and have 11
wonderful grandchildren; and

WHEREAS, there are people that are
destined to be together, this is true for Barbara
and Walter Thomas. The foretelling of this
marriage was first declared in 1956 by
Barbara’s mother, Lucy Reed. Lucy made her
predictions after viewing a picture of Walter
in his Army uniform. Neither Barbara nor
Walter could foresee the turn of events that
would bring them together for a lifetime; and

WHEREAS, Walter was a Master
Sergeant in the U.S. Army and stationed in
Lanstuhl, Germany. Germany was a long way
from his home in Lexa, Arkansas; but Walter
was determined to make the Army his career.
Barbara was finishing up her senior year of
high school in Newport News, Virginia. She
was enrolled in college and looking forward to
a career in nursing; and

WHEREAS, Walter had an army buddy,
Willie Blount. Willie was Barbara’s first
cousin. Among the many pictures of female
acquaintances and relatives, Willie carried
around Barbara’s picture. Sometime in 1957,
in Germany, Walter picked up Barbara’s
picture and immediately had to find out who
she was. Walter got Barbara’s address and
began writing her. He sent her a picture of
him in uniform; the very same picture Lucy
saw and made her prediction; and

WHEREAS, Barbara graduated from
high school and entered college. Walter

continued his career in the army. The two
continued to stay in touch through letters and
pictures. In January, 1958 Lucy Reed passed
away. So that she wouldn’t be alone in
Newport News, Barbara’s older brother, Jesse
Reed, sent for her to come live with him. Jesse
was stationed in the Navy in Baunholder,
Germany. Jesse wanted Barbara to continue
her education and knew she could do that while
living with him. So Barbara moved to
Baunholder and continued her education and
continued writing Walter; and
WHEREAS, In the spring of 1958,
Walter sent Barbara an invitation to the NCO
Ball. Barbara accepted the invite and made
plans to travel to Lanstuhl, Germany which
was a 1,000 miles from Baunholder. The NCO
Ball was the FIRST time Walter and Barbara
saw each other in the flesh. After a week with
each, they knew something was different.
Barbara returned to Baunholder and continued
writing; and
WHEREAS, Walter’s tour ended and he
returned to the states. While he was in
Germany, his family moved to St. Louis.
Walter joined his family in St. Louis and began
working as a clerk in a neighborhood drug
store. Jesse’s tour in the Navy ended and he
too returned to the states and settled down in
Newport News with his family and Barbara.
Barbara and Walter never lost touch with each
other and in August, 1959 saw each again for
the SECOND time. During the weeklong visit,
they enjoyed each other’s company and talked
about the next time they would see each other.
Walter while preparing to leave, realized
Barbara was the one for him and that he
couldn’t let her get away, so he proposed
before returning to St. Louis. The very next
time they saw each other, was April, 1960.
This was no usual one week visit; it was
lifelong visit, one that continues to this day.
Walter and Barbara’s union was formed in
Christ and it is through Christ that they are
able to stand hand in hand after fifty years of
matrimony; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate and recognize
50th Wedding Anniversary of Walter and
Barbara Thomas and we direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy to the end
that it may be presented to our honorees at a

WHEREAS, a multi-million dollar plaza,
named in her honor, will be open this summer
and serve as a lasting and visible contribution
of, and reminder of, her giving spirit. The
plaza, at Barnes Jewish Hospital, with its
trees, grass and pool, will provide a place of
refuge for patients, patient’s families, and

monument as Ellen’s caring spirit was a refuge
to many in her life; and

charitable and civic causes was the Central
Institute of the Deaf, for which she helped
raise over one million dollars; and

FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS
None.

SECOND READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Boyd introduced Resolution No.
331 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 331

WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon the
Board of Aldermen to express opposition of
the efforts to repeal the City of St. Louis’
ability to utilize current revenues raised from
its earning tax to fund city services and
expressing its intent to continue levying the
current voter approved earnings and profits
tax that funds basic and essential public
services to people living and working in the
City of St. Louis and opposing any legislation,
initiative or referendum repealing the earnings
and profits tax without the Board of
Aldermen’s prior endorsement.

WHEREAS, the citizens of the City of
St. Louis have twice supported the levying of
the earnings and profits tax; and

WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax
is the largest source of revenue funding the
annual City Budget approximately $140
million per year-providing 31% of General
Fund Revenues and 20% of all Governmental
Fund Revenues; and

WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax,
in whole or in part, funds numerous basic
services including but not limited to police
and fire protection, trash collection and
disposal, street preservation, animal control,
illegal dumping, tree trimming, neighborhood
preservation and revitalization, dangerous
building demolition, weed abatement, and
others; and

WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax
provides funding for tax increment financing
projects as well as other planning and
economic development functions; and

WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax
contributes to the diversity of the City of St.
Louis’ revenue structure and therefore has the
positive effect of moderating revenue declines
during economic downturns; and

WHEREAS, over the last 5 year, 10 year
and 20 year periods, the earnings tax has
experienced compound annual growth rates
of 2.7 %, 1.9% and 2.2% respectively; City
sale tax during those same periods half grown

at rates of 1.4%, 0.2%; and

WHEREAS, a diverse revenue structure
also collects income from a variety of bases
thereby no overburdening any particular
category of taxpayer; and
WHEREAS, the City would need to
more than double its current sales tax rate, to
approximately seven and one half percent, to
compensate for lost earnings and profits tax
income; and
WHEREAS, an increase of this size in
the City sales taxes would push the overall
sales tax rate in the City of St. Louis over
twelve percent, which would be considerably
greater than any other community in the metro
area; and
WHEREAS, statutory authorization
would be needed to propose an increase in the
local sales tax; and
WHEREAS, the City would need to
increase its aggregate existing total property
tax by approximately two and a half times
over $3 per $100 assessed validation to replace
lost earnings and profits tax income; and
WHEREAS, the impact of such a
increasing the property tax levy would
annually cost the owner of a $100,000.00
home and $15,000.00 automobile and
additional $750.00 and the owner of a
$200,000.00 home and $35,000.00 automobile
an additional $1,560.00; and
WHEREAS, the City would need to
receive statutory authorization to propose an
increase in its general property tax rate beyond
the current limit; and
WHEREAS, the loss of the earnings and
profits tax would require the City to file a
“material event notice” regarding its bond
portfolio, and this would have substantial
repercussions in the bond market unless the
City can present an acceptable plan for the
replacement of this income; and
WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax
is effectively a modestly progressive tax, while
the sales tax is effectively regressive, and the
property tax is effectively proportional; and
WHEREAS, local earnings or income
taxes are not uncommon among the nation’s
largest cities as one in four large urban cities
have an earnings or income tax; and
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis’
earnings tax is among the nation’s lowest at
one percent with a national average of two
percent and a high of 4.54 percent. Only one
U.S. city has a lower earnings/income tax rate,
0.7%, than the City of St. Louis. By
comparison, the Missouri state income tax
rate is six percent on taxable income exceeding

$9,000.00; and
WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax
receives some of its income from non-residents
who earn their income in the City of St. Louis
and thereby benefit from public safety,
transportation, maintenance, preservation, and
other basic services and increase the demand
for those services;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that:
Section 1.
That it is recognized that
the provision of basic and essential public
services to persons living and working in the
City of St. Louis requires a reliable means of
annual income and that the earnings and profits
tax is the single largest component of a diverse
revenue structure that funds those services.
Section 2.
That,
all
things
considered, the Board of Aldermen believes
that the earnings and profits tax is an integral,
equitable, and complementary component of
its overall revenue structure and should
continue to be levied for the foreseeable future
to insure the continued and reliable funding
and provision of public services.
Section 3.
That the Board of
Aldermen hereby opposes any legislation,
initiative or referendum, which would repeal
the earnings and profits tax without the Board
of Aldermen’s prior endorsement of such
action, and that such action should be
withdrawn forthwith until due consideration
and endorsement has been granted.
