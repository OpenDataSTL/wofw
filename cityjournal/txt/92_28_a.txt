Pastor Flem Ellis Bronner, Sr.
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Pastor Flem Ellis Bronner, Sr. will be honored
on Sunday September 27, 2009 at the
Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church for the
sixty years the famed Pastor Bronner has
spread his message of God through his music
and ministry; and
WHEREAS, Flem Ellis Bronner, Sr. was
born in Pertshire, Mississippi to the late
Robert T. and Blanche Bronner. He is the
youngest of nine children and was reared in a
close-knit family whose spiritual life
flourished under the love and guidance of his
parents, older siblings, late uncle and Pastor
Reverend Thomas Bronner. Flem began singing
at a young age in 1949 as the lead singer of
“The Evening Stars” through the inspiration
of his older sister, Blanche Bronner-Haney.
In 1955, “The Evening Stars” changed their
name to “The Bronner Brothers” and moved
to St. Louis, the home base of its music and

ministry; and
WHEREAS, on July 29, 1962, he
received his gift of a lifetime, his faithful and
loving wife, Mrs. Ozia Jennings Bronner, of
Howardville, Missouri. Several years later,

Flem E. Bronner, Jr., which completed their
family circle of love. Today, Flem E. Jr. plays
an integral part in his father’s music ministry
as a guitarist, and promoter; and

in 1979, Pastor Flem E. Bronner, Sr. was
ordained by his uncle, Reverend Thomas
Bronner at New Bethel Baptist Church in

world have witnessed this powerful and
prolific presentation; and
WHEREAS, on the 14th day of
September in 2002, after twenty long years
of faithful service to the Lord, and traveling
throughout Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois,

Ladder,” Pastor Flem E. Bronner, Sr. and his
son, Flem Ellis Bronner, Jr. launched a gospel
premier promoting the release of their new
CD/album titled “I Dreamed I Went to
Heaven.”; and
WHEREAS, during his tenure at St. John,
Pastor Bronner touched many lives, and saved
lost souls through his ministry. His ministry
is one of love and his motto is “Love has no
color,” and love is also colorblind, thereby
allowing his message to transcend all colors,
thnicity, minority groups, and socioeconomic
classes. Pastor Bronner’s spiritual walk with
Christ resonates in his daily life that he shares
with his family, church, community, and
friends; and
WHEREAS, under his leadership, St.
John, and the entire Missouri region, have had
the wonderful opportunity to meet many
famous gospel groups and ministers; The Soul
Stirrers, The Masonic Travelers, and of
course, the world famous Bronner Brothers.
His (late) Uncle Reverend T. B. Bronner,
