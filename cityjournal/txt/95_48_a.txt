various political and social positions/roles of
distinction; and

WHEREAS, the first African-American
Representative from Missouri, William “Bill”
Clay, Sr., served in the House for more than
three decades-longer than any other former
black Member of the House. During his
extensive tenure, he used his experience as a
civil rights activist and labor union
representative in St. Louis to promote
legislation to help minorities and U.S. workers.

inner-city constituents, who he believed
needed a strong voice in Congress; and

91st Congress (1969-1971), Clay joined two

neglected by the government.; and

Committee on House Administration from the
99th to the 103rd Congress (1985-1995),

Memorials. Clay reaped the benefits of the
House seniority system, rising through the
ranks of the Post Office and Civil Service
Committee (chairing two subcommittees) to
head the full panel during the 102nd and 103rd
Congresses (1991-1995) after nine terms of
service; and

WHEREAS, Clay was one of the 13
founding members of the Congressional Black
Caucus (CBC) formed in 1971. For nearly
two decades, he worked to revise the Hatch
Act of 1939, which restricted the political
activities of federal workers. Clay’s measure,
which became law in 1993, amended the Hatch
Act, permitting government employees to
publicly endorse candidates and to organize
political fundraisers, among other rights that
were previously prohibited.He also spent
several years promoting the Family and
Medical Leave Act, which passed earlier the
same year, mandating that companies with
more than 50 workers offer up to 12 weeks of
unpaid leave for employees to care for a
newborn or attend to a family medical
emergency.

WHEREAS, on Sunday February 24,
2013, in observance of Black History Month
and the 150th Anniversary of the
Emancipation Proclamation, the Charles
Sumner High School Alumni Association will
host their 10th Annual Membership RoundUp. The event will recognize and honor the
achievements of some of the City of St. Louis’
African American “Firsts in Their Field” in
various political and social positions/roles of
distinction; and

WHEREAS, Wiley Price, Jr. was a St.
Louis native, raised on Aldine on the north
side, a graduate of Sumner High School with
additional schooling in accountancy, and a
military veteran. Bernie Hayes says of Price’s
place in radio history, “He was something to
be idolized by the Black community. On the
air he was laid back, very sincere. Everybody
liked him”; and

WHEREAS, Wiley Price, Jr. got his first
radio job in 1944 at WTMV, then a local
powerhouse station with studios in the
Broadview Hotel in East St. Louis. He was 31
years old; and

WHEREAS, in the 1940s and ’50s, a
person could carve out a radio career by being
a savvy self-promoter. Station owners were
always interested if money could be made, so
many announcers would buy their own time
in hour-long blocks and then sell ads on their
programs. Wiley Price III says, “My father
could talk his way into anything”; and

WHEREAS, once Price had made his
case to WTMV management, he was given a
late night air slot. To his listeners, he became
known as “Mrs. Price’s Boy Wiley.” His radio
shows were a mixture of gospel and rhythm
& blues music, with gospel artists often
performing live in the studio. His on-air
approach was smooth and intelligent; and

WHEREAS, Price moved on to work as
a deejay on KXLW and KSTL, playing the
same mix of music he’d become accustomed
to on WTMV. He left the business when
station owners insisted he start playing a new
form of music that was being called “rock ‘n’
roll”; and

WHEREAS, the first African-American
to have his own radio show in St. Louis
suffered a stroke in 1961 and died at the age of
56 in 1969.
NOW

THEREFORE

BE

IT

RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
