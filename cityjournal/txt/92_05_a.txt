Resolution No. 335

Grace Bumbry
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Grace Bumbry is being honored as a St. Louis
legend at the “St. Louis Argus Lunch with the
Legends”; and

WHEREAS, Grace Bumbry was born
in 1937 in St. Louis, Missouri, to a freight
handler for the Cotton Belt Route railroad and
his wife, a Mississippi schoolteacher who had
once dreamed of becoming a singer herself. A
religious, middle-class couple, Benjamin and
Melzia Bumbry taught their three children to
count their riches in music. There were always

neighborhood kids rehearsing at the house after
school; there was singing around the piano in
the evenings; and there was warbling around
the washtub on Saturdays, when the family
did the laundry. Every Thursday night, the
parents went off to rehearse with their church
choir, while their sons, Benjamin and Charles,
sang in the youth chorus. Too young to stay
home alone, Grace tagged along with her
brothers, who eventually persuaded their choir
master to let her join the group, even though
she was younger than the other members; and

WHEREAS, Bumbry entered Sumner
High School with her eyes already fixed on
the concert sage. Determined to learn as much
as she could as fast as possible, she practiced
constantly, often storming home from music
lessons in tears when dissatisfied with her
own performance. The first of several
important mentors, no-nonsense voice teacher
Kenneth Billups guided her carefully, pacing
his lessons to her developing voice and reining
her in when she wanted to leap ahead; and

WHEREAS, In 1954 St. Louis radio
station KMOX held a teenage talent contest.
Billups encouraged his 17-year-old student
to enter, sharing her pleasure when she won.
Grace was now the proud possessor of a
$1,000 war bond, a free trip to New York, and
a $1,000 scholarship to the St. Louis Institute
of Music. The scholarship proved to be a
bitter blessing; it slammed her up against the
ugly reality of a prejudiced board of trustees
who offered her segregated private lessons at
the institute in lieu of admission alongside
other students. Rosalyn Story, in her book,
And So I Sing, recalled Melzia Bumbry’s
parting shot after an acrimonious meeting with
institute trustees: “It may be YOUR school,
but it’s MY daughter,” she said, and stalked
out; and
WHEREAS, Bumbry and Lotte
Lehmann arrived at Northwestern
simultaneously—Bumbry as a student,
Lehmann to offer master-classes. Bumbry
presented some meticulously prepared
operatic scenes and songs for Madame
Lehmann’s criticism and was thrilled to
receive an invitation to spend a summer at her
Musical Academy of the West in Santa
Barbara, California. Eager to see that nothing
stood in the way, Lehmann even arranged a
scholarship, which was partly funded by
comedian Anna Russell; and
WHEREAS, by 1960, Bumbry’s career
was clearly on its way. She made her debut at
the Paris Opera as Amneris in Verdi’s Aida
and signed a two-year contract with the Opera
House of Basel, Switzerland. However, these
events were but preliminaries to the big break,
which came later that year. Bumbry happened

to be in Cologne, Germany, when conductor
Wolfgang Sawallisch of Bavaria’s Bayreuth
Festival was searching for a possible Venus
for Richard Wagner’s opera Tannhauser. She
sang for him and was invited to audition for
Wieland Wagner, director of Bayreuth and
grandson of the composer; and
WHEREAS, Bumbry’s tour at the end
of 1962 mared her as one of America’s most
distinguished artists. Lasting nine exhausting
weeks, it consisted of a Carnegie Hall concert
debut as well as 25 performances in 21 other
cities, including St. Louis, where she sang for
a packed 3,000-strong house in the same
auditorium in which Marian Anderson had
thrilled her eight years earlier. She reveled in
the first family Christmas she had enjoyed in
years and also visited her alma mater, Sumner
High School, where she sat in on one of Mr.
Billups’s classes. The sight of the mentor who
had set her on the road to stardom reportedly
moved her to tears.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize opera legend, Grace
Bumbry and we wish her continued success,
achievement and accomplishment and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

family and friends. He created many wonderful
lasting memories with the ones he loved and
he will remain in those precious memories
forever; and

WHEREAS, he recommitted his life
totally to the Lord during his illness, and was
making plans to come back to church and
testify about the love of God. He shared his
testimony and preached to many who visited

Louis and we join with his many friends in
expressing our sorrow at his passing, and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a memorial
copy for presentation to the Anderson family,
at a time and place deemed appropriate by

and she is still a help to me in my business.
Not so much artistically, but she is very useful
in helping me with bookkeeping and
scheduling;” and

Steele through one of her clients, a shoe store
owner, who was working with the Grace Hill

Business Center, to work out a business plan.
They completed the plan and she has it ready
for when she will need it.
Currently, Jennifer is operating her business
out of her home to keep her overhead costs

has her business plan and all her backup

it has taken us a year and a half of pre-planning
to get it together;” and

with banks until the business could support
Ms. James full time. “Getting federally

process. Now that we are open, our business
has continued to grow in spite of the national
economic downturn,” James said. “I love to
teach others how to make wine so it is really
fun!” she concluded; and

WHEREAS, James and Seitz noted that
their business is shifting from individual
consumers to corporations. As budgets
tighten, companies come in for special label
wines made at the shop or extravagant-looking
baskets at an affordable price; and

WHEREAS, now that their business is
growing and expanding in scope, they have a
part-time employee working with them who
is a chemist by trade and brings his expertise
to their business. They have another parttime employee who works with party events,

either on or off-site. They work with nonprofit organizations, bottling and labeling wine
for tasting at an individual ticket price.

Resolution No. 387

1780 Revolutionary War Battle of
Fort San Carlos at St. Louis
WHEREAS, In July, 1779, Spain joined
the American Revolutionary War against Great
Britain. Great Britain had ordered its generals
in Canada to begin expeditions against Spanish
settlements on the Mississippi River a few
weeks before this. Their mission was to drive
out the rebels led by George Rogers Clark.
Clark learned of this and warned the Spanish
Commandant at Saint Louis, Fernand de Leyba,
in March, 1780 to prepare for an attack.
DeLeyba began fortifying the village; and

WHEREAS, with money from the
villagers and his own resources, and with
volunteer labor, he began to construct a tower
which we call Fort San Carlos at what is now
the intersection of 4th and Walnut Streets.
He also had the villagers dig a mile-long trench
from each side of the tower to the riverbank.
The Spanish brought cannons to place in the
tower from an abandoned fort; and

WHEREAS, around 1 PM on May 26,
1780 the large force of Indians, fur traders and
seasoned troops under British command
attacked the village. These attackers found
the village to be protected by the tower and
about 200 armed defenders; and

WHEREAS, however, some villagers
were surprised working in the fields, and about
21 were killed and 70 captured. The cannon
fire alarmed the Indians and they withdrew.
The British western campaign failed. The
village of Saint Louis was never attacked again.
The same day George Rogers Clark and his
army defeated the British at Cahokia.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 1780
Revolutionary War Battle of Fort San Carlos
at St. Louis and we direct the Clerk of this
Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to further prepare a commemorative copy to
the end that it may be presented to our honoree

Resolution No. 389
90th Anniversary of Southampton
Presbyterian Church
WHEREAS, the Southampton story
begins at Tyler Place Presbyterian Church,
early in 1913. A visionary elder, Dr. R.R.
Vaughn, was certain a church was needed in
the new Southampton subdivision. Dr. Vaughn
had visited the area and had been told they
needed a day school, not a Sunday school. A
Presbytery survey showed not a single
Presbyterian family in the community. On
July 13, 1914, a blistering hot Sunday, Dr.
John Roemer, Tyler Place’s pastor, with
Vaughn and others, started a Sunday School
in a room over a plumber’s shop at Devonshire
and Macklind. Forty-six people were present.
The next Sunday there were eighty-five; and
WHEREAS, In 1915, the plumber’s
shop burned down. The Sunday School
moved to a much larger space over a drug store,
later Finishing Products Corp. Worship was
started by the Rev. J.H. Gauss. The next
year, with help from Tyler Place, the northeast
corner of Nottingham and Macklind was
purchased, and a red-brick chapel built toward
the rear of the property. The Rev. Albert
Keller came as missionary pastor. In 1918,
the Rev. Williamson Vater was called. It was
then that Southampton Church was organized
and came into being on Good Friday, April
18, 1919; and
WHEREAS, When Rev. Vater left in
1920, the Rev. William Murdoch, home on
furlough from mission fields in India, remained
to supply the pulpit and served for 30 years.
When it was built, the chapel had seemed more
than adequate. But growth was so rapid that
soon a large tent was pitched on the front
lawn to house some of the Sunday School
classes; and

WHEREAS, in 1924, ground was broken
for the first basement unit of a new church
building. It was an extension from the chapel
south along Macklind, built at a cost of
$36,000. In two years, the membership had
doubled. By 1929, a building fund was again
started, to complete the projected church. The
ensuing market crash and depression
postponed plans. Finally, in November 1940,
the congregation moved to Buder School for
services. On June 8, 1941, the cornerstone of
the present Southampton Presbyterian
Church was laid.The stone arch and entrance
doors of the basement church became the main
entrance to the new sanctuary and dedication
took place on the last day of May 1942; and

WHEREAS, Under these pastoral
leaders, the church developed deep roots and
reached out into the community. The 1980’s
brought a national change. The northern and
southern assemblies became the Presbyterian
Church, U.S.A., healing a breach dating to the
Civil War. The two local bodies, in a service
of reunion, came together as the Presbytery
of Giddings-Lovejoy. In 1988, St. Louis was
host to the two-hundredth General Assembly;
and

WHEREAS, they now worship in
smaller quarters. We painted unused rooms,
bought new carpeting and thirty chairs. Their
first service in the new Chapel was held on
February 10, 2008.
Southampton
Presbyterian Church remains a Church of
Christ’s Compassion.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED BY the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 90th
Anniversary of Southampton Presbyterian
Church and we further direct the Clerk of this
Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to further prepare a commemorative copy to
the end that it may be presented to our
honorees at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 390

Wunderlich Fibre Box Company
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Wunderlich Fibre Box Company will be
receiving the Mayor’s Spirit Award on April
23, 2009; and

WHEREAS, Charles Wunderlich
established his cooperage shop in 1860,
manufacturing barrels for local businessess,
traders and settlers. In 1892, the Charles
Wunderlich Cooperage Company became the

first legally incorporated cooperage in
Missouri. The company still sits on the
original site, which at its founding, allowed
easy access to the Mississippi River, the main
means of transportation for many goods at
that time; and

WHEREAS, The Charles Wunderlich
Cooperage Company produced barrels until
the 1930s, when the prevalence of boxes, fibre
drums and plastics began to change the
industry. The company officially changed its
name to Wunderlich Fibre Box Company.
Exclusive production of cardboard products
began in the early 1960s; and
WHEREAS, since its founding,
Wunderlich Fibre Box Company has been run
by direct descendents of Charles Wunderlich
and is now entering the 6th generation of
family leadership. The company continues to
prosper due to the hard work and loyalty of
so many of its employees. At present, over
half of the employees have been with
Wunderlich Fibre Box for over 30 years.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Wunderlich Fibre
Box Company for their outstanding
achievement and continued success and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 377
Employee Free Choice Act
WHEREAS, In 1935, the United States
Congress enacted the National Labor
Relations Act, which protects the rights of
most employees in the private sector to
organize labor unions and bargain collectively
with their employers through representatives
of their own choosing; and
WHEREAS, The freedom to form or join
a union is internationally recognized by the
1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights
as a fundamental human right; and
WHEREAS, Unions benefit communities by strengthening living standards,
stabilizing tax bases, promoting equal
treatment and enhancing civic participation;
and
WHEREAS, AFL-CIO statistics
indicate that unions help raise workers’ pay
and narrow the income gap for minorities and
women, by increasing median weekly earnings
by 31 percent for union women workers, 36
percent for African American workers, 46
percent for Latino workers and 8 percent for
Asian American workers; and
WHEREAS, According to the Economic
Policy Institute, unionized workers are more
likely than their non-unionized counterparts
to receive paid leave, are approximately 18%
to 28% more likely to have employer-provided
health insurance, and are 23% to 54% more
likely to be in employer-provided pension
plans; and
WHEREAS, According to the AFLCIO, despite the benefits that union
membership offers employees and their
families and communities, workers across the
nation are routinely denied the freedom to form

unions and bargain for better wages and
conditions, with 25 percent of private-sector
employers involved in illegally firing at least
one worker for organizing campaigns related
to union activity; and
WHEREAS, AFL-CIO data also
indicates that 77 percent of the public believes
it is important to have strong laws protecting
the freedom of workers to make their own
decisions regarding the formation of unions,
and that 60 percent of workers would join a
union if they had the chance; and
WHEREAS, S.1041, introduced in the
United States Senate and sponsored by Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, and H.R. 800,
introduced in the House of Representatives
by Congressman George Miller, jointly
referred to as “The Employee Free Choice
Act,” would amend the National Labor
Relations Act to establish an efficient system
to enable employees to form, join, or assist
labor organizations, and provide for
mandatory injunctions for unfair labor
practices during organizing efforts; and
WHEREAS, The Employee Free Choice
Act would also provide stronger penalties for
violations committed by employers against
employees during any period while
employees are attempting to form a union or
negotiate a first contract with an employer,
and would provide a mechanism for mediation
and arbitration where parties are unable to
reach an agreement; and
WHEREAS, In general, the Employee
Free Choice Act would safeguard the ability
of workers to make their own decisions about
forming a union, and establish meaningful
penalties when employers violate workers’
rights; now, therefore, be it
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis calls upon the United
States Congress to pass S./H.R., “The
Employees Free Choice Act”, which would
amend the National Labor Relations Act to
establish an efficient system to enable
employees to form, join or assist Labor
Organizations , and to provide for mandatory
injunctions and stronger penalties for unfair
labor practices during organizing efforts and
we further direct the Clerk of this Board to
spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and make it
available to the public.

Resolution No. 378

Metro Funding
WHEREAS, in an effort to restore
transit service to the St. Louis region as soon
as possible, Metro has requested a one-time
emergency appropriation of Thirty-Five
Million Dollars from the State of Missouri
which, if obtained, will restore transit service
to the St. Louis region; and

WHEREAS, numerous employees and
employers are frustrated and are in danger of
losing their jobs because they have lost their
only means of transportation. Businesses are
considering closing, because their employees
are unable to get to work due to the elimination
of over 2,300 bus stops and entire bus routes;
and

WHEREAS, with the high cost of
gasoline, tens of thousands of our fellow
citizens are now forced to seek car pools or
other transportation arrangements that can be
difficult on a family struggling financially to
make ends meet; and

WHEREAS, the difficult economic
environment we face in the St. Louis region is
headed into a prolonged downward spiral with
the loss of our public transportation system.
The loss of public transportation is poised to
create a catastrophic economic disaster for
thousands of workers and businesses in this
region; and

WHEREAS, in addition to daily
ridership service reductions, Metro will be
forced to reduce special event ridership
options. That means no special events trains
will be added for Cardinals, Rams and Blues
games. In 2009, St. Louis will host Major
League Baseball’s All Star Game. The region

will be front and center on an international
stage. A quality transit system will play a
critical role in how our region is perceived and
enjoyed by visitors from around the world.
Service reductions will negatively impact the
quality of special service that Metro will be
able to offer during the festivities; and
WHEREAS, twenty-four percent
(24%) of Metro’s 2,320 employee workforce
will lose their jobs. Both union and salaried
positions will be lost. What’s even a greater
blow to the regional economy is that according
to outside sources, as many as 12,000 to 16,000
jobs may be lost by those unable to access
their current jobs; and
WHEREAS, in the midst of this public
transportation crisis, thousands of hard
working individuals, the elderly and members
of the disabled community that depend on
public transportation for their jobs, shopping,
and medical appointments are depending on
the State of Missouri to support this
emergency appropriation.
WHEREAS, these funds shall be spent
solely and only for the purposes mentioned
in this resolution.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis endorses the request of
Metro for an emergency appropriation of
funds from the State of Missouri and strongly
encourages the elected officials of the State of
Missouri to afford Metro’s request the
greatest consideration and we further direct
the Clerk of this Board to send a copy of this
Resolution to the Governor of the State of
Missouri, the Speaker of the House and the
President Pro Tem of the Senate of the
Missouri General Assembly.
