MAIN TERMINAL
RENOVATION PROGRAM
M/WBE OUTREACH SESSION
Thursday, November 15, 2007

The City of St. Louis, through the
Lambert St. Louis International Airport®
Authority, is launching a major program to
redefine, renovate, and enhance terminal,
concourse, and passenger support facilities at
the Airport. The renovations will re-establish
Lambert as the new “front-door” to St. Louis.

As the City embarks on this program,
we will issue a series of Requests for
Qualifications (RFQs) to interested
architectural and engineering design firms
experienced in airport terminal renovation
projects. The City has established Minority
Business Enterprise/Women Business
Enterprise (M/WBE) participation goals of
25% and 5% respectively for this program.
To further support the City’s commitment to
involving M/WBE firms in meaningful roles
on all consultant work, we are employing two
strategies.

First, a M/WBE Outreach Session has
been scheduled for 9 a.m., November 15, 2007
at the Renaissance Hotel Airport, 9801 Natural
Bridge Road. The M/WBE Outreach Session
provides the opportunity for interested
consultants to learn about the renovation
program from the City and its Program
Manager, as well as form strategic

partnerships for pending business
opportunities. Prime consultants attending
the Outreach Session will receive five (5)
bonus points to the scoring of their eventual
Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) submittal.
Secondly, M/WBEs attending the
Outreach Session will have an advance
opportunity to complete the M/WBE
Capabilities Profile which the City will
distribute to registered recipients of the RFQs.
Each firm receiving this notice is invited to
return the attached Profile.
Please contact Lambert’s renovation
Program Manager at 551-5086 or email
dwmewshaw@lambert-stl.org no later than
November 12, 2007 to confirm your
