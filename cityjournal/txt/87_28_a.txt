hazard mitigation program that assists
communities in their efforts to become

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
Ms. Young introduced Resolutions No.
141 through145 and the Clerk was instructed
to read same.

Resolution No. 141
WHEREAS, the class of 1984 of the
Saint Louis University School of Law has been
summoned to reconvene in this the centennial
year of the 1904 World’s Fair and the
bicentennial of the Meriwether Lewis and
Roger Clark exploration of President Thomas
Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase – the 186th year
of the founding of Saint Louis University as
St. Louis College (chartered 172 years ago as
Saint Louis University); and
WHEREAS, the class of 1984 reflects
on those “halcyon” days when students still
referred to the Omer Poos Law Library, then
attached to Morrissey Hall (yet a new building,
though leaking at the edges), and remember
the heat of the Socratic method played out in
sometimes chilly basement lecture hall
bunkers; and
WHEREAS, some of us choose to
remember very little of the pain of the
uncertainty of the duty of care and elements
of foreseeability trolled out in the British
accent of Nic Terry or John Griesbach’s amazing blackboard and weeks upon weeks of
wild animal stories; and
WHEREAS, what’s that you say?
Esmeralda has fulfilled her promise to climb
the flagpole! – Has she no “consideration”?
It seems we endured this love-filled barking
just weeks ago by the Kingsfield of contracts,
our own “Dean of the Law School”(actually
Rudy Hasl) – Vince Immel; and
WHEREAS, we count the 20 years like
the “bundle of sticks” (who hasn’t referred to
those with a client – let’s be honest?) in Pete

Salsich’s hand and strain to hear the remaining
whispers of Joseph J. Simeone – still echoing
of our non-partisan court plan; and

WHEREAS, oh what characters those
professors were and what characters we have
become; and

WHEREAS, this weekend of October
8-10, 2004 the class of 1984 recollects with
family and friends and shares memories,
hopes, dreams and aspirations – some
achieved and some yet to be realized.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to note this 20 year milestone
for the 1984 graduates of the Saint Louis
University School of Law. We wish those
who understand this resolution (the 1984
graduating class), their families and friends a
safe and fun Reunion and we thank them for
their many contributions to this country and
to our great City of Saint Louis. We further
direct the Clerk of this Board to prepare a
commemorative copy of this Resolution to
the end that it may be presented to our
honorees at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.
