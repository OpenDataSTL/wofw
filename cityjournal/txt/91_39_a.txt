No. 258 through 260 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 258

The New Sunny Mount Missionary
Baptist Church Chancel Choir
WHEREAS, on Friday September 23,
1977, the Reverend Donald Hunter was called
to Pastor the New Sunny Mount Missionary
Baptist Church (NSM). This dynamic
spiritual leader was indeed the answer to many
prayers; and

WHEREAS, Reverend Hunter brought
with him Brother Ronald Metcalf, as Minister
of Music, who formed the New Sunny Mount
Chancel Choir, which transformed the quality
of music at New Sunny Mount; and

WHEREAS, Reverend Hunter also
declared New Sunny Mount as the “Church
in the Sun of Righteousness for Missions to
the World.” As such, the gospel music
produced by the Chancel Choir was so
spiritually inspiring and worshipful, that Rev.
Hunter wanted to share the choir with the
entire world. Thus, he encouraged Brother
Metcalf and the Chancel Choir to record an
album, and in 1979 they did just that; and

WHEREAS, a few years thereafter,
Brother Metcalf was called to New York, New
York for a dream-fulfilling experience on

Broadway. To fill his enormous void and
responsibility, Rev. Hunter summoned other
extraordinary music leaders, which included:
Leo Davis, Gregory Gettis, Deborah Shipp,
and for a short time, Dello Thedford; each
directing the Chancel Choir to new heights in
the Gospel and in the worship experience at
New Sunny Mount; and
WHEREAS, the New Sunny Mount
Missionary Baptist Church Chancel Choir,
now under the direction of the incomparable
excellence of Minister of Music Anita WatkinsStevens, has moved to even greater heights
and accomplishments. The Chancel Choir
won First Place in the Verizon Wireless St.
Louis Region “How Sweet the Sound” Gospel
Choir Competition, on Saturday September
13, 2008 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis.
As the first place winner, the choir received
$10,000 for New Sunny Mount, and the title
of “The Best Church Choir in the of St. Louis,
Missouri Region”; and
WHEREAS, as regional winners, the
New Sunny Mount Chancel Choir was
invited to compete nationally in Atlanta,
Georgia, on November 8, 2008. What a
wonderful experience for the Chancel Choir,
New Sunny Mount, and the many friends and
family members who viewed the national
competition by satellite or accompanied the
choir to Atlanta! The Chancel Choir
represented New Sunny Mount and the St.
Louis Region well. Although New Sunny
Mount did not win the national competition,
the Chancel Choir is forever a winner in our
hearts. We are so very proud of the New
Sunny Mount Missionary Baptist Church
Chancel Choir and Anita Watkins-Stevens,
Minister of Music; and
WHEREAS, with Reverend Donald
Hunter, Pastor and great visionary of faith, at
the helm, New Sunny Mount has proven that
with a “working faith” you can accomplish
great things, produce immeasurable joy, and
with God all things are possible.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to honor
the New Sunny Mount Missionary Baptist
Church Chancel Choir for their
accomplishments and we further direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a copy for
presentation to the honoree, at a time and place
deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

partnerships in the public and private sectors
for the St. Louis Housing Authority while

eliminate drugs in HUD housing
developments; and

with the Missouri Department of Mental
Health (DMH) as the Housing Coordinator

people in 3 1/2 years; and
