COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR

President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 203 through No. 208 and No. 212 through
No. 222 and the Clerk was instructed to read
same.

Resolution No. 203

The 25th Anniversary of Take 6
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Take 6 is celebrating their 25th anniversary;
and

WHEREAS, Take 6 is the most awarded
vocal group in history (10 Grammy Awards,
10 Dove Awards, a Soul Train Award, and
more); and

WHEREAS, Take 6 (Claude McKnight,
Mark Kibble, Joel Kibble, Dave Thomas, Alvin
Chea and Khristian Dentley), heralded by
Quincy Jones as the “baddest vocal cats on
the planet!” is the quintessential a cappela
group and model for vocal genius. Six virtuosic
voices united in crystal clear harmony, against
a backdrop of syncopated rhythms, innovative
arrangements, and funky grooves that bubble
into an intoxicating brew of gospel, jazz, R&B,
and pop; and

WHEREAS, with praise from such
luminaries as Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder,
Brian Wilson, Ella Fitzgerald and Whitney
Houston, the multi-platinum selling sextet has
toured across the globe, collaborated across
genres, and is recognized as the pre-eminent a
capella group in the world. With the
popularity of televised vocal competitions
such as the explosive a cappella show The
Sing Off and the mania over singing driven
comedy-dramas like Glee and Smash, Take 6
is the original torchbearer; and

WHEREAS, two major recent events
reminded everyone of this as Take 6 triumphed
among a gathering of stars including Celine
Dion, Lionel Richie, Justin Timberlake, Stevie

Nicks, Ne-Yo, and more. At Walmart’s 50th
Anniversary celebration, Take 6 captivated
the audience with their rendition of the Louis
Armstrong hit, What A Wonderful World.
Showing the global reach of this phenomenal
group, Take 6 closed the show with Ladysmith
Black Mambazo to a standing ovation! Two
weeks later at the behest of legendary Producer
Phil Ramone, Take 6 thrilled a sold-out
audience at the Songwriters Hall of Fame
Awards performing with and honoring
legendary singer-songwriter Ben E. King on
his classic “Stand By Me.”; and
WHEREAS, Take 6 has come a long
way from their days at Huntsville, Alabama’s
Oakwood College where McKnight formed
the group as The Gentleman’s Estate Quartet
in 1980. When tenor Mark Kibble heard the
group rehearsing in the dorm bathroom, he
joined in the harmonies and performed on stage
that night. When Mervyn Warren joined
shortly afterward, they took the name
Alliance. Yet, when they signed to Reprise
Records/Warner Bros. in 1987, they found
that there was another group with the same
name, so they became Take 6. Their selftitled debut CD won over jazz and pop critics,
scored two 1988 Grammy Awards, landed in
the Top Ten Billboard Contemporary Jazz
and Contemporary Christian Charts, and
they’ve never slowed down. What makes the
music and the group last this long? The
answers are direct and simple: faith, friendship,
respect, and love of music; and
WHEREAS, such qualities garnered
them awards beyond musical category - a Soul
Train Award and two NAACP Image Award
nominations. From their exceptional live
performances to their recordings, these
qualities remain at the heart of the Take 6
phenomenon.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 25th anniversary
of Take 6 and we wish them continued
success, achievement and accomplishment and
we further direct the Clerk of this Board to
spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 204

Take 6 and The St. Louis Symphony
IN UNISON Chorus
WHEREAS, Take 6 is celebrating their
25th anniversary and is the most awarded
vocal group in history (10 Grammy Awards,
10 Dove Awards, a Soul Train Award, and
more; and

WHEREAS, Take 6 (Claude McKnight,
Mark Kibble, Joel Kibble, Dave Thomas, Alvin
Chea and Khristian Dentley), heralded by
Quincy Jones as the “baddest vocal cats on
the planet!” is the quintessential a cappela
group and model for vocal genius. Six virtuosic
voices united in crystal clear harmony, against
a backdrop of syncopated rhythms, innovative
arrangements, and funky grooves that bubble
into an intoxicating brew of gospel, jazz, R&B,
and pop; and

WHEREAS, created in 1994, The St.
Louis Symphony IN UNISON Chorus began
as a one-time effort for the performance of
Hannibal Peterson’s African Portraits. Due to
the overwhelmingly positive response, the
Chorus has become a permanent part of the
Symphony’s artistic family. The Chorus

Resolution No. 208

Uan and Sue Nguyen, Bill Kent, Jr.
and Mark Keoshkerian
WHEREAS, the CWEA Renaissance
Award recognizes groups and individuals who
have made a significant positive economic or
social impact in the Central West End; and

WHEREAS, the 2013 Renaissance
Award is given to Uan and Sue Nguyen, Bill
Kent, Jr. and Mark Keoshkerian for their roles
in the dramatic revitalization of the 4400-4500
blocks of Olive Street; and

WHEREAS, Uan and Sue Nguyen are
developers of the Lister Building, the TaylorOlive Building and the Eugene Field School
Apartments. Before Bowood Farms, before
Kennedy Park, and before the new Gaslight
Square, Sue and Uan Nguyen began
transforming the corner of Olive and Taylor,
where there had been no significant capital
infusion for over 30 years. The Lister Building

Annex to the west of the corner had already
collapsed, and the Lister Building on the corner
“didn’t even have a roof”; and
WHEREAS, Sue and Uan Nguyen
completely rebuilt and refurbished the critical
corner Lister Building, just moments ahead of
the wrecking ball. The Nguyens went on to
acquire and renovate the former Field School
into sought after loft apartments, and to
renovate the Taylor Olive building into a
successful mixed use project. The Nguyen’s
Lister Building has been recognized by
Landmark’s Association as a Most Enhanced
building, and led the way in demonstrating
the residential living opportunities on Olive.
Without the Nguyens’ commitment, the
neighborhood surely would have lost the Lister
Building and quite possibly the other buildings
as well; and
WHEREAS, Bill Kent, Jr. is the
Executive Director of the Youth Learning
Center at 4471 Olive Street. The Youth
Learning Center (YLC) is founded on the belief
that every child can be successful given the
right opportunities and supportive
environments. Minister Willie L. Kent, Sr.,
and Ray and Judy DeLuca Ford founded the
organization in 2003 as Youth Technology and
Education Center (YTEC); and
WHEREAS, under the leadership of Bill
Kent Jr. and with a dedicated staff of certified
teachers, graduate students and volunteers,
The Youth Learning Center provides a unique
academic and enrichment program dedicated
to providing children from underserved
communities, with access to high quality and
engaging after school and summer
programming. Their many successful students
and their motto “We Challenge the Status
Quo” explain it all. The opportunities they
provide and their beautiful new building and
well maintained landscape make them a great
neighbor for the residents and businesses on
Olive; and
WHEREAS, Mark Keoshkerian is
developer of 4440, 4443, 4445, 4448 and 4449
Olive Street. Mark renovated four dilapidated
and unlivable properties and built brand new
townhomes to transform the 4400 block of
Olive. 4440 and 4448 had been abandoned for
decades, most developers had written them
off as just too far gone Mark’s skill, talent and
fortitude proved the other guys wrong; and
WHEREAS, Mark’s conviction that “if
you build it (a quality product), they will
come” proved successful. Next, Mark moved
across the street to renovate two more
buildings and build brand new modern style
townhomes. These townhomes were the first
new residential construction on that block in

over 80 years. Landmarks Association
recognized the renovation of The Shriners Hall
building with its “Most Enhanced” award in
2011. Mark has demonstrated that the area
was a viable market, not just for rental
apartments but for Condo ownership as well.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we wish to recognize
Uan and Sue Nguyen, Bill Kent, Jr. and Mark
Keoshkerian on being awarded the 2013
Central West End Renaissance Award, and we
wish them many more years of success; and
we further direct the Clerk of this Board to
spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of this proceeding and to prepare a
