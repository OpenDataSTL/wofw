COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR

President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 134 through 135 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 134

St. Samuel Temple
WHEREAS, St. Samuel Temple, one of
the first churches started under the leadership
of the late Bishop Columbus Williams, was
founded by Elder Samuel Moore Sr. along with
his wife, Mother Elizabeth Moore, in 1964;
and

WHEREAS, the first church was
located in a small storefront on the corner of
Dr. Martin Luther King and Clara Avenue.
The membership was made up of a handful of
adults and their children. Memories of the coal

stove, the frequent prayers and that hand of a
stranger passing money through the side door
from time to time comes to mind. There were
many tests during this period however, God
saw Pastor Moore through it all. Many souls
were saved, reclaimed and delivered in this
small mission; and

WHEREAS, a larger, more permanent
home was provided at 1330 N. Taylor which
opened its doors in 1972. They are so honored
to the many members both past and present
that helped them. Many souls were saved,
many healings, delivered and set free during
the leadership of their founder, Pastor Moore;
and

WHEREAS, Pastor Samuel Moore
passed away in August 2006, gone but never
forgotten. Elder Donnie Moore had been
serving faithfully in the ministry with his
father and the torch was passed to him in
April 2007; and

WHEREAS, in spite of the many
challenges, Pastor Donnie Moore has
persevered. St. Samuel Temple has undergone
several interior upgrades during the period
before the demise of our former leader to the
present. Mother Moore transitioned in
December of 2009. She too will forever be
missed and in their hearts. Mother Moore
established portrayed a picture of faith
throughout her life as a saint of God in spite
of the many challenges. One noted phrase was
“I might be hopping but I ain’t stopping.” ;
and
WHEREAS, there have been various
land acquisitions since 2006. The vision of
expansion and community outreach is more
visible than ever. Miracles, healings,
deliverance and the filling with the Holy Ghost
is upon us. May they continue to do their
best, for “We’ve Come This Far by Faith.”
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize St. Samuel Temple
and we thank them for their many
contributions to the City of St. Louis and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
Introduced on the 21st of September, 2012
by:
Honorable Samuel L. MooreAlderman 4th Ward

Resolution No. 135
The 9th annual Fuzzball with the
Fuzz Benefit Tournament

WHEREAS, On October 7, 2012, Brian
Rossomanno and fellow members of the St.
Louis Police Department will be hosting the
9th annual Fuzzball with the Fuzz benefit
tournament. For those of you not familiar
with fuzzball, it is a south city past time very
similar to cork ball. It is played with a cork
ball bat and tennis balls; and
WHEREAS, each year this tournament
benefits a different person or family in need,
or an organization committed to a worthy
cause and each year the event has grown. The
previous eight “Fuzzball with the Fuzz”
tournaments have raised a total of more than
$60,000 for various beneficiaries which have
included injured officers, the families of
officers killed in the line of duty and as the
result of off-duty accidents, ill officers and
their family members, members of the
community and United States Marines injured
in combat overseas; and
WHEREAS, this year we selected one
of their own. Sgt. Rick Lingard was shot
several times during a burglary in progress at
his home on March 22 of this year. Sgt.
Lingard continues to work very hard to return
to duty. He has been without the ability to
work secondary to help provide for his family
for an extended period of time. This along
with mounting co-pays and his wife being
forced to cut back on her work to assist in his
recovery has resulted in a growing need for
assistance. Sgt. Lingard is very hesitant to
ask, but fortunately, he doesn’t have to; and
WHEREAS, This year’s event will be
held at Woerner School at 6131 Leona on
Sunday, October 7th, 2012 at 9:00 a.m.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the many
contributions of the 9th Annual Fuzzball with
the Fuzz Benefit Tournament to the City of
St. Louis and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy to the end
that it may be presented to our honoree at a
time and place deemed appropriate by the
Sponsor.
