Resolution No. 274
Resolution in Support of HR 1746,
the Community Access
Preservation Act (CAP)
WHEREAS, public, educational and
government (PEG) access channels are one of
the last surviving sources for local television
programming across the country, and PEG
access channels play a significant role in the
City of St. Louis; and
WHEREAS, the government access
television studio under the Communications
Division has been producing public service
television since 1991, and the public access
and educational access channels in the city
televise a wealth of programming focused on
our communities and needs within the
community; and
WHEREAS, “Information is as vital to
the healthy functioning of communities as
clean air, safe streets, good schools and public
health”, according to the Knight Commission
Report, On the Information Needs of
Communities in a Democracy, 2009); and
WHEREAS, government channels play
a major role in the transparency of government
by keeping the electorate informed through
the weekly televising of the Board of Aldermen
meetings, committee meetings and hearings,
town hall meetings, Mayoral press events,
Ward news and events, and the promotion of
city services serves as a critical resource of
information for residents; and
WHEREAS, public access channels
televise hundreds of programs every year
produced by more than 50 local residents and/
or groups who use public access channels to
get their messege out to the public, providing
a window through which viewers can
experience the diversity of culture and
entertainment, recreational activities,
community events, faith based programming
and artistic endeavors in their local

community…creating television for the people
and by the people; and

WHEREAS, the movement of PEG
channels from low accessible channels on the
dial and placing them on higher number
channels limits public access by placing an
unnecessary barrier to watch these resource
channels. Customers are blocked from
accessing these PEG channels unless they
purchase monthly digital box services or buy
a digital television; and

WHEREAS, it is critical to a wellinformed and participatory democracy that
we assure equal access to PEG channels and
preserve service provider funding for PEG
channels, so that these channels continue to
be available to the entire community and to
serve the residents of the City of St. Louis in
the manner in which they have become
accustomed; and

WHEREAS, there is currently pending
before Congress H.R. 1746, which would
establish the Community Access Preservation
(CAP) Act; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act would amend
the Communications Act of 1934 to provide
for carriage and display of PEG channels
without additional charges, and via channels
whose quality, accessibility, functionality and
placement is consistent with commercial
channels; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act would
preserve PEG channels and the much needed
funding for PEG facilities and operations, and
ensure that the channels continue to be
available to the entire community; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act would
provide important solutions for critical and
immediate financial needs of PEG channels
and facilities by unrestricting the use of PEG
franchise fees for any PEG related purpose;
and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act would require
the Federal Communications Commission to
submit a report to Congress relative to the
impact of state video service franchising laws
on PEG cable systems and channels since
2005; and

WHEREAS, in states that have enacted
state level franchising laws since May 31,
2005, the CAP Act would require each cable
operator to continue to provide financial and
infrastructure support and channel capacity
based on the support historically provided
by the cable operator; and

WHEREAS, the CAP Act ensures
technological neutrality by applying PEG
requirements to all landline video service

providers, regardless of the transmission
protocol; and
WHEREAS, HR 1746, the Community
Access Preservation (CAP) Act, provides
important solutions for critical and immediate
threats to PEG channels and facilities across
the country by removing use restrictions on
Public, Educational and Government (PEG)
access fees, restoring PEG revenue streams,
and ending cable operators’ discriminatory
treatment of PEG channels.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT BY THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN OF THE CITY
OF ST. LOUIS, that we pause in our
deliberations to support H.R. 1746, which
would establish the Community Access
Preservation (CAP) Act and amend the
Communications Act of 1934 to provide for
carriage and display of public, educational,
and governmental (PEG) channels in a manner
consistent with commercial channels. We
further urge our U.S. Congressional Delegation
to take all possible actions in support of the
passage of H.R. 1746, including but not limited
to endorsing, co-sponsoring, working for rapid
passage, and voting for H.R. 1746. We further
direct the Clerk of this Board to prepare a
copy of this Resolution and mail it to each
member of our U.S. Congressional Delegation:
Senator Roy Blunt, Senator Claire McCaskill,
Representative William “Lacy” Clay and
Representative Russ Carnahan.
