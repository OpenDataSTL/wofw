Resolution No. 20 was assigned to the
Committee on Ways & Means.

Resolution No. 23
Whereas, inpatient rehabilitation is an
important intervention of care for many
patients in St. Louis who require intensive
rehabilitation care and services and,
Whereas, rehabilitation hospitals and
units are important members of the healthcare
provider community in St. Louis, and their
existence benefits the communities they serve
and,
Whereas, there is a federal regulation,
commonly known as the “75 Percent Rule”
that rehabilitation hospitals and units must
adhere to and that requires them to treat
specified numbers of patients having specific
medical conditions or diagnoses and,
Whereas, the impact of the “75 Percent
Rule” upon patients and providers is
significant and substantially deeper than
initially projected by the Federal Government
and,
Whereas, legislation has been
introduced in both chambers of the United
States Congress, H.R. 1459/S. 543 that would
alleviate the impact of this Rule and would
help protect patients’ access to inpatient
rehabilitation care and services.
Now Therefore Be it Resolved, that
the St. Louis Board of Aldermen views H.R.
1459/S. 543 as sound public policy that would
be good for the citizens of St. Louis, desires
to see its enactment into law, and encourages
the Missouri Congressional Delegation to
work to ensure such enactment. Introduced
