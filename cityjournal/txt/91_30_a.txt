Resolution No. 180

Reverend Donald Hunter
WHEREAS, on Friday September 23,
1977, the Reverend Donald Hunter was called
to Pastor the New Sunny Mount Missionary
Baptist Church (NSM), located at 6080 West
Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63136. This
dynamic spiritual leader was indeed the answer
to many prayers. He was not just an ordinary
man, for he came with a multiplicity of ideas
that also brought “Hope” to replace “Despair;”
“Determination” to replace “Doubt;” and most
importantly, “Purpose,” a charge from God
to do what seemed like the impossible; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Hunter brought
with him Brother Ronald Metcalf, who
formed the Chancel Choir that transformed
the quality of music at New Sunny Mount.
By December 1979, under Rev. Hunter’s
leadership, membership had more than tripled.
Pastor Hunter ended the “Lease-Purchase
Agreement” and found the funds to purchase
outright the building located at 6080 West
Florissant Avenue; and
WHEREAS, under Rev. Hunter’s
leadership New Sunny Mount has learned to
step out on faith and to take God at His Word
“that you shall have life and have it more
abundantly.” This man of God, this “Visionary

Servant of Great Faith,” envisioned a Retreat
and Ranch facility. That faith became reality
on September 3, 1989, with the dedication of
the 319 acre New Sunny Mount Ranch and
Retreat Site, that was open to all
denominations and organizations as a place to
fish, camp, fellowship and study and pray;
and
WHEREAS, in 1990, also, NSM
purchased 4-1/2 acres of land on 2 lots at
Shreve and West Florissant Avenues, on which
the new church is built. The completion of
the New Sunny Mount Missionary Baptist
Church facility not only provides space for
the spiritual development of the people, but
also social and economic development; and
WHEREAS, during February 1998, Rev.
Hunter along with Terry Mills, Herbert
Boykin, Walter Coleman, Saul King, Umphy
Smith and Curtis Triggs, known as the
“Magnificent Seven,” under the supervision
of Senior Deacon Arthur Walker, who gave
support, prayer and encouragement,
transformed the previous bus garage into a
beautiful temporary worship facility. NSM
worshipped there for 14 months while the
new Church was under construction; and
WHEREAS, on the first Sunday in June
1999, New Sunny Mount marched from 6080
West Florissant to the new building designed
and built to the specifications of Pastor
Hunter and the New Sunny Mount Missionary
Baptist Church Family, located at 4700 West
Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63115; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Hunter has
declared New Sunny Mount as the “Church
in the Sun of Righteousness for Missions to
the World.” As such, under the leadership of
Reverend Hunter, NSM has become more
active in community outreach programs, and
ministries locally, nationally, and
internationally; and
WHEREAS, New Sunny Mount
Community Outreach is an avenue that has
allowed the church to truly live up to its motto
as a “Church in the Sun of Righteousness for
Missions to the World.” With Reverend
Donald Hunter as Pastor at the helm, a great
man of Faith, New Sunny Mount has proven
that, with a “working faith,” you can
accomplish great things, produce immeasurable
joy, and with God all things are possible!
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to honor
Reverend Donald Hunter for his years of
dedication and commitment to the City of St.
Louis and we further direct the Clerk of this
Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and

to prepare a copy for presentation to the
honoree, at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 181

DEAF Way
WHEREAS, in March of 1998, a
committee of Deaf, and dedicated staff of
Paraquad got together to flesh out the mission
and vision of an organization. It had to fit
with the Independent Living philosophy of
Paraquad, and still maintain its autonomy; and

WHEREAS, the name DEAF Way was
thought to encompass the true essence of the
company in that we wanted to make it clear
to the community of Deaf and the people who
interact with them that DEAF Way is
customer driven; and

WHEREAS, DEAF Way was created
with a unique vision in mind and a desire to
provide interpreting services that empowered
people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing to
have a clear, effective communication in any
situation; and

WHEREAS, DEAF Way has grown in
leaps and bounds from the humble office of
one interpreter to a fully trained staff of 9
full-time staff interpreters, 3 support staff, 1
part-time interpreter staff and a list of Deaf
professionals who serve as Communication
Development Specialists.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and thank DEAF
Way for the services they provide in the City
of St. Louis and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy to the end
that it may be presented to our honoree at a
time and place deemed appropriate by the
Sponsor.

Honorable Lewis E. Reed, President Board ofAldermen

Resolution No. 182

WHEREAS, we pause in our
deliberations to note the homegoing of St.
Louis resident and pastor, Reverend David
Henry Booker; and

WHEREAS, David Booker was born on
November 11, 1929 to Rosie Mae Bland and
William Booker in Senatobia, Mississippi; and
WHEREAS, David Booker was

ordained in April 1952 at the Macidonia
Baptist Church in Yellow Bush County,
Mississippi, and served in the ministry under
Reverend Deberry; and
WHEREAS, On February 28, 1950,
David married the love of his life Ernestine
Cook (who proceeded him in death) and to
this union two sons were born, Michael and
Cedric; and

WHEREAS, Reverend Booker proudly
served as pastor of the Burning Bush MB
Church for fifty four (54) years. He took an
active role in serving the members of Burning
Bush as well as serving the community; and

WHEREAS, Reverend Booker leaves
behind his two sons, Michael and Rev. Cedric
Booker (Min. Donna), brothers; W.B. Daniel,
John, and sisters; Lizzie, Nellie, grandchildren;
Patrick II, Aaron, Angela, Alissa, Esther
Lohgan, Angel Rania, Kristian, and Telesa; and
others who proceeded him in death. He was
loved by many and will truly be missed.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to celebrate
the life of Reverend David H. Booker to the
citizens of the City of St. Louis and we join
with his many friends in expressing our sorrow
at his passing, and we further direct the Clerk
of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
