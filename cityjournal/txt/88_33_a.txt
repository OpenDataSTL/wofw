PUBLIC NOTICE
The Housing, Urban Development and
Zoning Committee of the St. Louis Board of
Aldermen will hold a Public Hearing on
November 30, 2005 at 10:00 A.M. in the
Kennedy Room (208) in City Hall:

BOARD BILL NO. 289
Introduced By
Alderman Alfred Wessels
An ordinance establishing and creating a
Planned Unit Development District for a
portion of City Block 4614 to be known as
the “Dogtown View Planned Unit
Development District”.

BOARD BILL NO. 251
Introduced By
Alderwoman Dionne Flowers
An ordinance pertaining to Special Use
Districts, providing for the establishment
qualifications and procedures for Special Use
Districts, and containing an emergency clause.

WHEREAS, the Strategic Land Use Plan
was adopted by the City of St. Louis Planning
Commission on January 5, 2005 (the “Plan”)
as a roadmap for future activities which will
occur over a long period at the initiative of
city businesses and neighborhood residents
and in response to interest from developers;
and

WHEREAS, the Plan is intended to
improve the quality of life for those who work
and live in St. Louis by encouraging
appropriate types of development and
preservation in clearly defined locations; and

WHEREAS, the Plan is intended to be
the basis for additional planning and
development initiatives including commercial
development plans and neighborhood level
plans as well as tailored rezonings; and

WHEREAS,
existing
Zoning
designations are often problematic in the City,
it is anticipated that these adopted zoning
designations will be modified to conform to
the Plan and that a specific Special Use
District (“SUD”) may be adopted to reflect
the specific character within specific
Commercial Zoning Districts (“F”
Neighborhood Commercial District, “G” Local
Commercial & Office District, and “H” Area
Commercial District) and related business
oriented Zoning Districts (“J” Industrial
District and “K” Unrestricted District).

NOW THEREFOR BE IT
ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS

AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION ONE. Prohibit New or
Expanded Use within SUD Boundaries
A) The purpose for creation of a SUD
as an overlay zoning district for a
specific Zoning Districts area should
be to assist in the implementation
of the Plan, Commercial District
Redevelopment Plan(s) and/or an
adopted Neighborhood Plan for a
specific geographic area of at least
two (2) contiguous acres per a metes
and bound legal description.
B)

The purpose for creation of a SUD
as an overlay zoning district for a
specific Zoning Districts area should
also respond to well-defined health,
safety, moral and/or general welfare
problems. A specific SUD
ordinance shall state the problems
addressed by any use being
prohibited or limited within the
SUD area.

C)

A specific SUD ordinance may
reduce the time period for
discontinuing non-conforming uses
within the specific SUD area from
the existing one (1) year to a shorter
time period not less than thirty (30)
days.

D)

A specific SUD ordinance may
prohibit the creation of uses or the
expansion of existing uses that are
permitted or conditional uses under
existing Commercial Zoning
Districts (“F” Neighborhood
Commercial District, “G” Local
Commercial and Office District and
“H” Area Commercial District) and
related business oriented Zoning
Districts (“J” Industrial District and
“K” Unrestricted District).

E)

The Residential Dwelling Districts
(“A” Single-Family, “B” TwoFamily, “C” Multiple-Family, “D”
Multiple-Family,“E” MultipleFamily) may be included in a
specific SUD ordinance only if the
Residential Dwelling District has an
existing problem land use addressed
in the specific SUD ordinance.

SECTION TWO. Allowance of New
or Expanded Use within SUD Boundaries as
Conditional Use
A) A specific SUD may promote
flexibility and fairness under a new
SUD ordinance by making it
possible to allow new or expanded
uses within the SUD subject to the

Conditional Use provisions of
Section 26.80.010 of the Zoning
Ordinance of the City of St. Louis.
In a SUD area a specific SUD
ordinance may require that a use
that is presently zoned as a
permitted use, a conditional use or
a prohibited use be subject to the
Conditional Use process in Section
26.80.010.

B) A specific SUD ordinance may
further regulate a permitted use with
additional restrictions because it has
been or may in the future be
expected to be the cause of the
emergence of well defined problems,
and thus require that use become a
conditional use subject to the
provisions of Section 26.80.010.
C)

A specific SUD ordinance may allow
an existing conditional use to remain
as a conditional use, but may subject
that use to a specific list of
limitations and subject that use to
the provisions of Section 26.80.010,
to address the well defined problems
with that type of use which the City
has documented.

D) Given the goal of promoting
flexibility and fairness in
Commercial Districts, a specific
SUD ordinance may make it
possible to treat a prohibited use
less restrictively than previously
because through the conditional use
process contained in Section
26.80.010 a specific SUD ordinance
may substantially reduce, avoid or
mitigate potential damage to
adjacent property.

SECTION THREE Types of Items that
May be Included in Specific SUD Ordinance

A) A specific SUD may deal with a
range of criteria including: 1)
maximum size or height of building;
2) number of parking spaces for
employees, customers and/or
visitors; 3) signage; 4) carryout
windows; 5) landscaping buffers
and fences; 6) percentage of lot
landscaping; 7) refuse enclosures
and dumpsters; 8) vehicular and
pedestrian access; 9) outdoor
lighting; 10) hours of operation; 11)
prior record of business owner,
operator and employees involving
identified problem land uses; 12)
time limits for accomplishment of
the conditions; and/or; 13) specific
criteria that address unique aspects
of the identified problem land uses

and the identified geographic area
in a specific SUD ordinance.
B)

Conditional use review procedures
used in a specific SUD ordinance
will include a forty_five (45) day
review period by the staff of the
Zoning Administrator and a fifteen
(15) day pubic notice period before
the required Conditional Use
Hearing. If a Conditional Use
Permit is issued, it shall be valid for
one (1) year after issuance, but can
be declared null and void by the
Zoning Administrator if the work
to be done to establish the
conditional use is not completed and
an occupancy permit from the City
is not issued within one (1) year
after the written approval of the
conditional use.

C)

Under the Conditional Use
Standards of Section 26.80.010 of
the Zoning Ordinance of the City
of St. Louis the approval of the
proposed use: 1) can not be
detrimental to the public; 2) can not
cause injury to neighbor’s property
or reduce value; 3) should enhance
the general welfare; 4) should be a
compliment or compatible use; and
5) the Zoning Administrator, Board
of Public Service and the Board of
Adjustment may add and require
additional conditions and
restrictions from time to time.

D) In developing conditions for the uses
under a specific SUD ordinance or
the conditions to be imposed on a
specific use, the following criteria
shall also be considered regarding
the approval and/or conditions for
the operation of the proposed use:
1) existing and proposed site
topography; 2) existing and
proposed land use on the SUD site
and/or up to one thousand (1,000)
feet from the SUD site; 3) density
of commercial activity on and near
the proposed site; 4) location of the
site relative to major thoroughfares
or public transit routes; 5)
availability of public parks,
playgrounds, open space and
schools near the proposed site; 6)
the impact of the proposed use on
existing buildings, structures or
other facilities with architectural,
historical or cultural significance on
the SUD site and/or up to one
thousand (1,000) feet from the SUD
site; as well as 7) existing
landscaping including trees over six

(6) inch caliper, formal garden(s),
fountains, statues and/or sculptures
on the SUD site.
SECTION FOUR. Emergency clause.
This being an Ordinance for the immediate
preservation of public peace, health and
safety, it is hereby declared to be an immediate
measure within the meaning of Sections 19
and 20 of Article IV of the Charter of the City
of St. Louis and therefore this Ordinance shall
become effective immediately upon its passage
and approval by the Mayor.
Any person wishing to speak for or
against the above cited board bill should be
present.
