WHEREAS, Katie is a very special little
girl who was born with Pyruvate
Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Deficiency,
an extremely rare mitochondrial disease; and

WHEREAS, mitochondria are
specialized compartments present in every
cell of the body except red blood cells and are
responsible for creating more than 90% of the
energy needed by the body to sustain life and
support growth; when they fail, less and less
energy is generated within the cell; this cell
injury, when repeated throughout the body,
can cause whole systems to fail; symptoms
can include muscle damage, mental retardation,
seizures, a build-up of lactic acid leading to
excess acid in the body, or failure of organ
function including that of the heart, kidneys
or liver; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Douglas S. Kerr is a
leading authority on PDC Deficiency; his
research focuses on the molecular basis of the
well-known defects of this disease including
measuring the activity of enzymes and their
components and analyzing altered messenger
RNA and genomic DNA; his goal is to improve
techniques for diagnosis and genetic counseling

of affected families, to utilize naturally
occurring mutations to better understand
normal processes of synthesis, assembly, and
function of these enzymes, and to develop
effective strategies for nutritional approaches
to therapy; and
WHEREAS, Rainbow Babies and
Children’s Hospital, located in Cleveland, Ohio
is a world leader in the treatment of children
with endocrine and metabolic disorders, cancer,
heart disease, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary

and continues its commitment to providing
the support and education parents need in
order to understand their child’s condition,
treatment plan, and potential responses to
medication;
WHEREAS, throughout her life Katie
have enjoyed the constant love of her parents,
family, friends and many supporters who will
come together on Tuesday, December 12 at

deficiency research at Rainbow Babies &
Children’s Hospital;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the
