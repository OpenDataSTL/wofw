FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.
273 and requested that it be assigned to the
Public Utilities Committee for hearing.

Resolution No. 273

WHEREAS, video franchising by the
Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis
has led to successful deployment of video and
broadband services throughout the City,
without discrimination to any resident or
business, and such franchises are best
governed by each local jurisdiction, and not
the State; and

WHEREAS, since 1984 the Board of
Aldermen of the City of St. Louis, Missouri,
negotiated, issued, transferred and renewed
cable TV franchises in a prompt and fair
fashion for commercial entities to build and
operate video and TV systems and make a
commercial profit using our local public rightsof-; and

WHEREAS, this Board continues to
support choice of video providers to benefit
all its citizens and supports true competition
between video providers under one set of
regulations for all companies; and

WHEREAS, this Board holds public
hearings, researches both community needs
and operator needs in regards to video
services, and - as elected officials responsible
to our citizens and businesses - makes carefully
balanced decisions about those needs prior to
executing video franchises; and

WHEREAS, this Board has always
allowed reasonable amounts of time for
operators to construct or upgrade their
systems throughout our city, while firmly
prohibiting redlining or similar discriminatory
business practices; and

WHEREAS, our local economy benefits
most when regulations support deployment
of advanced telecommunications systems that
are available to all of our residential
neighborhoods, commercial districts, schools,
large and small businesses, so that these
entities also may compete effectively with
each other on equal terms and are not
disadvantaged by lack of access or choice;

Now, therefore, be it resolved by the
Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis,
Missouri that:
to promote diversity of thought in an era
of media consolidation, all video service
operators should be required to carry and
support Public, Educational and
Governmental Access Channels, which
allow our citizens to see news, features,
documentaries, public meetings, local

events, and cultural programs not shown
on other channels, offer college credit
courses and other educational training to
students and adults, and provide training
and jobs in the field of video production;
and
to promote public safety in times of crisis,
all video providers should be technically
capable of and required to run the City’s
emergency alert messages on all channels
of their system; and
to protect consumers, customer service
standards must be promulgated and
enforced at the local level, and legitimate
customer complaints and problems about
video services must be able to be resolved
in a timely fashion; and
to protect the City and its citizens from
damage, harm or financial loss, franchises
must require bonds, insurance and
indemnification as part of the privilege
of using public property; and
to avoid discrimination among our
citizens and businesses, all video
providers should be required to serve the
entire city within a specified number of
years;
and for these reasons, that the Board of
Aldermen of the City of St. Louis
opposes SB 816 and any similar
legislation that usurps our reasonable
long-standing authority to grant
competitive video franchises, or
eliminates our ability to renew existing
franchises with cable operators at the
expiration of their current term; or
allows providers of video and cable TV
services, to “cherry-pick” only those
neighborhoods they want to serve, rather
than all of our citizens and businesses,
like the incumbent cable operator, or
fails to provide meaningful consumer
protections which are enforceable at the
local level; or
fails to require support and carriage of
local Public, Educational and
Governmental (PEG) Access Channels
between t PEG facilities and subscribers;
or
fails to allow the City to communicate
with its citizens during public
emergencies; or
gives unfair advantages to one video
provider over another, chooses winners,
or puts at risk the long-term viability of
competitive systems and real consumer
choices;

and for these reasons, video franchising
should continue to governed by the individual
local government in whose public rights-ofway such commercial entities operate so that
circumstances particular to our community
can be effectively and fairly addressed.
