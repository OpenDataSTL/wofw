Introduced on the 27th day of October, 2006
by:
Honorable Stephen Gregali,Alderman 14th Ward
Honorable Joseph Vollmer,Alderman 10th Ward

Resolution No. 141

Whereas, the month of October has been
designated as Domestic Violence Awareness
Month; all over the country battered victims’
advocates, government officials, corporations,
unions, health care providers, and faith-based
groups will participate in activities and events
to raise national consciences about domestic
violence; and

Whereas, the National Coalition Against
Domestic Violence created Domestic Violence
Awareness Day in October 1981; the goal was
to bring together advocates working to end

violence against women and children; the first
observance of Domestic Violence Awareness
Month took place in 1987, and was
subsequently endorsed by Congress in 1989;
every October since then, the issue of
domestic violence has been highlighted in local
and national venues all over the country; and
Whereas, although anyone can become
a victim of domestic violence or intimate
partner violence (IPV), women are still more
likely to experience IPV than men; people
from all economic and cultural backgrounds
can be subjected to domestic violence; and
Whereas, sadly, children are often the
direct or indirect victims; just witnessing
violence impacts children’s lives, especially
as it usually takes place at home, a place where
children should feel safe; if children have been
exposed to domestic violence, it increases the
chances that they will take on the role of either
a “batterer” or a “victim” in their adult
relationships; abuse can seem “normal” to
youth who witness it in their own homes; and
Whereas, often alcohol and illicit drugs
play a part in domestic violence; the link
between substance abuse and violence has
been clearly documented in numerous studies;
partner history of alcohol and drug abuse is a
strong risk factor for domestic violence;
violent behavior can also interfere with
treatment for substance abuse and substance
abuse can impede interventions to change
violent behavior; drugs or alcohol can impair
both the batterer’s and victim’s ability to make
sane and safe choice;. substance abuse can
distort communication, aggravate resentments,

October 27, 2006.

To the President of the Board of
Aldermen:

The Committee on Public Safety to
whom was referred the following Resolutions
report that they have considered the same and
recommend adoption.

Resolution No. 129

WHEREAS, the federal courts recently
banned all executions in Missouri citing that
the present practice causes “unconstitutional
pain and suffering”; and

WHEREAS, the present execution
system in Missouri includes the use of an
anesthesiologist who was found to be dyslexic,
has been banned from practicing medicine in
two hospitals and who has been sued more
than 20 times for malpractice; and

WHEREAS, over the past years the
death penalty system in the State of Missouri
has had numerous complaints of being
capricious and arbitrary resulting in innocent
people being wrongfully convicted and
sentenced to death in Missouri; and

WHEREAS, according to data in a study
of death sentencing in Missouri by Michael
Lenza, a University of Missouri sociologist,
entitled The Prevailing Injustice in the
Application of the Death Penalty in Missouri
(1978-1996) gross disparities are clearly
indicated in the sentencing of minorities with
the death penalty compared to other groups
throughout Missouri in a variety of instances;
and
WHEREAS, African-Americans
represent almost half (almost 48%) of those
facing execution in Missouri but comprise
only 11.7% of the state’s population; and
WHEREAS, according to several reports
a large majority of those persons facing capital
charges are indigent can not afford their own
attorney; and
WHEREAS, the State of Missouri now
ranks 4th in the nation in the number of
citizens executed, with only Texas, Virginia
and Oklahoma having executed more people
since the death penalty was reinstated; and
WHEREAS, many Missourians are
calling for an end to state executions and
national polls have consistently shown a
majority support for a moratorium with over
2600 groups nationwide calling for a
moratorium on executions, including over 80
Missouri organizations and faith communities;
and
WHEREAS, there have been numerous
highly publicized cases both nationally and in
Missouri where individuals serving on death
row for years have later been found innocent
which further calls into question the fairness
of this practice, and
WHEREAS, around the country there
have been growing numbers of groups,
organizations and individuals that have
proclaimed the innocence of individuals on
death row with compelling arguments

including movements in support of the
innocence of Larry Griffin, Marlin Gray and
Reggie Clemons, and
WHEREAS, the Circuit Court of the
City of St. Louis has embarked upon an
investigation into the possible wrongful
execution of Larry Griffin, which is an
unprecedented act in this country by a
prosecutor; and
WHEREAS, during the 2005-06
legislative session HB 1496 was introduced
before the Missouri General Assembly calling
for a moratorium on all executions and
establishing a Commission on the Death
Penalty to study the use of the death penalty
in Missouri; and
WHEREAS, in the opinion of many,
fairness and justice compel that the provisions
of HB 1496 be at least reconsidered by the
Missouri General Assembly during the next
legislative session including the assembly
considering a permanent moratorium;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for
the City of St. Louis that we support the
intent of HB 1496 and we call upon the
members of the Missouri General Assembly
to reconsider this legislation as well as consider
a permanent moratorium on all executions in
Missouri.
