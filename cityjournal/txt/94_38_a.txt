SECOND READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Conway introduced Resolution No.
242 (Committee Substitute) and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 242
(Committee Substitute)

WHEREAS, in 2010 the City of St.
Louis closed the Gasconade shelter to the
public. Gasconade was obsolete and inhumane.
It was built during World War II as a catchand kill facility; and
WHEREAS, since 2010, the City animal
control division partnered with Stray Rescue
to implement a catch-and-adopt policy. The
City’s partnership with Stray Rescue has
resulted in fewer loose dogs on our streets,
more adoptions and fewer euthanizations at
less cost to the taxpayers; and
WHEREAS, since the closure of
Gasconade in 2010, the City is running a
smaller animal control facility and its
employees are more focused on enforcing the

law. So, it is issuing more citations. The
Citizens Service Bureau (CSB) is getting fewer
calls for loose animals. The public is safer and
animals are being treated better; and
WHEREAS, as far as the City has come
in one year, it can do better. Building a new,
state-of-the-art City-run animal control
facility would cost more than $4-million; and
WHEREAS, when the City formed its
partnership with Stray Rescue in 2010, it
knew it would have to make adjustments and
improvements. It is. The City’s goals in Phase
II of its original plan are the following:
•

Use the Animal Protection Facility
Restoration Fund for the purpose of
paying the costs related to the
construction and maintenance of a new
animal protection facility at Stray
Rescue to provide shelter space;

•

Increase the number of City animal
control specialists on the streets to
remove loose and dangerous animals
while enforcing ordinances;

•

Increase kennel capacity by adding a
City owned and managed facility;

•

Improve communications between
animal control, CSB and Police
Department to speed up response to
loose animal calls;

•

Expand adoption in place to help lowincome families keep pets they could
not otherwise afford;

•

Create and manage a Lost Dog Registry;
and

•

Produce written agreements between
the City and Stray Rescue to define
roles and responsibilities.

WHEREAS, Ordinance 65435,
approved February 15, 2002, established, in
part the “Animal Protection Facility
Restoration Fund” for the purpose of paying
the costs related to the construction and
maintenance of a new animal protection
facility; and
WHEREAS, Section Four of such
Ordinance provides that Funds maintained in
“Animal Protection Facility Restoration”
account shall be used only to pay for all costs
related to the construction of a new Animal
Protection Facility and for materials and
equipment required to properly maintain such
facility; and
WHEREAS, Section Five of such
Ordinance provides that the Director of
Health and Hospitals shall recommend the use
of said funds to the Health and Human Services

Committee of the Board of Aldermen which
shall determine the capital improvements for
which the funds should be used, which use
shall be consistent with this ordinance, and
the Director, upon resolution passed by said
Committee shall have the authority to prepare
the necessary vouchers for such use of funds
and the Comptroller, upon receipt of such
voucher, shall draw warrants on the Fund. No
part of such funds shall be used for any general
operating purpose or expense, salaries, or
advertising; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance
65435, the Director has forwarded her
recommendations to the Chairman of the
Health and Human Services Committee; and

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED that pursuant to Ordinance
65435 the Health and Human Services
Committee does hereby approve the
recommendations of the Director for the
appropriation of the Animal Protection
Facility Restoration Fund Account funds
attached hereto and Exhibit A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that
copies of this resolution are to be maintained
by the Clerk of the Board of Aldermen; printed
in the Journal of the Board of Aldermen and
delivered to the Director of Parks, Recreation
and Forestry, the Budget Division and the
Comptroller.
