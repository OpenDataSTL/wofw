Resolution No. 39

RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
WHEREAS, since its early beginnings,
the City of St. Louis has been a city of
significant ethnic, gender, racial and cultural
diversity and like the nation has struggled over
the years to overcome discrimination and
disenfranchisement while attempting to shape
a civic personality truly centered and based in
democracy; and

WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis has
long recognized that citizen diversity is a most
valuable asset and consistently strives to
increase diversity among its workforce and
contractors to accurately reflect the
composition of the City; and

WHEREAS, over the years this effort
toward diversity, parity and inclusion has
resulted in significant local and national
legislation and court decisions aimed at
reflecting the growing national and local
consciousness that inclusion and equity are
essential components of democracy and is
ultimately beneficial to all, encourages better
community interaction, cooperation, tolerance
and understanding; and

WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the
United States ruled in Grutter v. Bollinger,
539 U.S. 306 (2003), that Affirmative Action
is necessary to achieve true democracy in our
increasingly diverse and multicultural nation;
and

WHEREAS, California businessman
Ward Connerly has recently launched what
many believe to be a misleading and deceptive
campaign entitled “Missouri’s Civil Rights
Initiative “ that would amend Missouri’s
Constitution crippling Affirmative Action;
eliminate the City’s ability to consider racial
and gender disparities in the areas of law
enforcement, personnel hiring and university
admissions; reverse many of the current
advancements made in St. Louis and Missouri
toward gender and race equality; and
irreparably harm the ability of all Missouri
residents to enjoy an equal opportunity in
healthcare, education and employment; and

WHEREAS,
numerous
civic
organizations, labor unions, business

associations, educational institutions, religious
groups, ethnic groups and women’s
organizations oppose the adoption of this
amendment; and
WHEREAS, this Board also recognizes
the laudable efforts of The Missouri Annual
conference of the AME Zion Church, SEIU
Local 2000, and MOSES for their efforts in
educating the community about this issue and
opposing the “Ward Connerly amendment”;
and
WHEREAS, this Board of Alderman
recognizes the need for Affirmative Action
toward making St. Louis a better place to work
and live for its diverse citizenry.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED that the St. Louis Board of
Aldermen reaffirms its support for diversity
and affirmative action programs and opposes
the deceptive and divisive “Missouri Civil
Rights Initiative” and the constitutional
amendment it proposes, as it fails to advance
the civil rights of St. Louis City citizens and
runs contrary to the promotion and
continuance of diversity, parity and progress
in the City of St. Louis and directs the Clerk
of this Board prepare a copy of this resolution
so that it may be presented to those deemed
appropriate by it’s sponsor.
