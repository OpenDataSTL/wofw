COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR

President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 337 through 354 and No. 356- through
363 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 337

195th Anniversary of
First Baptist Church of St. Louis
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
First Baptist Church of St. Louis will be
celebrating its 195th Anniversary; and

WHEREAS, First Baptist Church traces
its origin to the First African Baptist Church,
organized in 1817. First African Baptist
Church was the first Protestant congregation
established for African Americans in St. Louis.
All of the city’s Black Baptist churches
developed from it. The church grew out of
Sunday school and religious services organized
in 1817 by two Baptist missionaries: Reverend
John Mason Peck (1789-1876) and Reverend
James Welch; and

WHEREAS, John Berry Meachum
(1789-1854), a former slave who bought
freedom for himself and his family, assisted
Peck with the school and religious services. In
1822, African-American worshippers formed
a separate branch of the church under the
direction of Meachum, then a layman. In 1825,

after he was ordained a minister, Meachum
founded the First African Baptist Church and
became its first pastor. A brick church building
was erected at the same address in 1827.
Membership then numbered about 220, of
whom 200 were slaves; and
WHEREAS, shortly after the church
was built, Meachum and Peck opened a day
school at the church under the disguise of a
Sunday school. This undercover operation,
called “Candle Tallow School,” charged a
monthly tuition of one dollar for those who
could afford to pay. No one, including slaves,
was ever turned away; and
WHEREAS, Meachum also owned a
barrel factory and steamboats, one of which
was equipped with a library. Between 1826
and
1836,
Meachum
purchased
approximately twenty slaves. He employed
them in his factory until they earned a trade
and saved enough money to buy their
freedom. He remained pastor of First African
Baptist Church until his death in 1854. He is
buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery; and
WHEREAS, First African Baptist
Church, now First Baptist Church, moved to
fourteenth and Clark streets in 1848, and in
1917 to its present address at Bell Avenue.
The church later purchased the adjacent four
family flat and converted it into an educational
building. The church was burned to the ground
in 1940 and was reconstructed on the same
site within thirteen months; and
WHEREAS, the pastor, Rev. Henry L.
Midgett, received his Bachelor of Science
Degree in Mechanical Engineering from North
Carolina A&T State University. After
accepting his calling to preach the gospel, he
attended the Carolina University of Theology,
where he received his Associates and Bachelor
of Arts Degrees in Biblical Studies. Rev.
Midgett has served as a board member of
many community and civic organizations
including: United Way of the Piedmont
Advisory Board, Salvation Army Advisory
Board, Habitat for Humanity, Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity, Inc. and Toastmasters
International.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize First Baptist
Church of St. Louis on their 195th
Anniversary and thank them for their
innumerable contributions to the City of St.
Louis in the community and we further direct
the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of
this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to

our honorees at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Caranhan and the Honorable Freeman R.
Bosley, Jr., presented him with proclamations
designating June 3, 1994 as “Rev. Dr. Willie J.
Ellis Jr. Day.” Bishop Ellis serves as a Board
Member of the Commissioners, and
Commissioner for the Missouri State Public
Defenders Office. On October 8, 2001 in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, at a meeting
of the United Supreme Council of the Ancient
and Accepted Scottish Rite, Bishop Ellis was
created a Grand Inspector General of the 33rd
Degree. In June 2001, Rev. Ellis became the
first consecrated Bishop of the Philadelphia
Assemblies of Full Gospel Churches
(PAFGC) in the Midwest. The PAFGC
operated in 50 states and internationally. He
served as regional Bishop for five states. In
June 2002, he chaired the National Baptist
Congress of Christian Education Pre-Musical
1,000 Voice Choir that was held in St. Louis,
Missouri. Bishop Ellis was President and
Chief Executive Officer of the New Northside
Family Life Center, Conference Center and
Child Development Center; and
WHEREAS, Bishop Ellis was known
throughout the St. Louis area as well as
nationwide for his civic leadership and
community work. Many have described him
as “A Man with a Vision”. His belief in the
institution of family and being a father caused
him to envision the Child Development Center.
His vision of the Child Development Center
was two fold: 1) Parents needed credible
community child development center; and 2)
for many it would eliminate transporting the
children to an unfamiliar environment. In
November 1990, the New Northside Child
Development Center was opened. The New
Northside Child Development Center
provides the children who attend(ages 6 weeks
through 13 years) with a Christian, educational
and family atmosphere, and is accredited by
the Missouri Accreditation of Childhood Care
and Education Program; and
WHEREAS, Bishop Ellis had many
favorites. His favorite saying was, “Let the
work I’ve done speak for me.” His favorite
songs were “The Lord Will Make Away
Somehow”, “I Won’t Complain”, and “My

Soul’s Been Anchored.” Those that visited
Bishop knew that his last words to them were
“Amen.” The Lord prepared our family with
the words, “God has Spoken, let the Church
say Amen.”

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
remember the many contributions of Bishop
Willie James Ellis Jr. to the citizens of the
City of St. Louis and we join with his many
friends in expressing our sorrow at his passing,
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
memorial copy for presentation to the Ellis
family, at a time and place deemed appropriate
by the Sponsor.
