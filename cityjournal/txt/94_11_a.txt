Resolution No. 93
Steve Mizerany
WHEREAS, Steve Mizerany was the
youngest of seven children born to Alexander
and Deeba Mizerany, who immigrated to the
United States from Lebanon. A native of St.
Louis, he grew up in a three-family flat located
at 1042 Park Avenue in the LaSalle Park
neighborhood. His father, Alexander, was a
professor who taught English to other
Lebanese immigrants at St. Raymond’s
Maronite Church; and

WHEREAS, Steve attended St. Vincent
de Paul Catholic Grade School, where he
helped build the stone grotto of the Virgin
Mary, which still stands today; and
WHEREAS, in 1946 Steve’s two oldest
brothers opened an appliance store “Mizerany
Brothers King of High Trades” at 3849 S.
Broadway. Steve went to work for them and
invited his childhood friend, Joe Farhatt, to
join him. Steve and Joe would walk up and
down Broadway going door to door telling
people to shop at this new store. After making
their sales, Steve and Joe then delivered the
appliances in a small pickup truck. It was not
until they dropped a refrigerator down several
flights of stairs, that the older brothers finally
hired a professional delivery service; and
WHEREAS, Steve’s older brothers
decided to advertise on television, they asked
Steve to do the commercials. All television
was live at that time, and Steve ad-libbed the
commercials as the cameras were rolling. Many
people called the television station
complaining about Steve’s awful grammar and
the unorthodox commercials; he once
accidentally started a fire at the television
studio during a stunt. But these same people
would come to the Broadway store to meet
Steve and buy something. In the St. Louis
area, Steve Mizerany pioneered the early
frontiers of making television commercials;
and
WHEREAS, in 1972 he co-founded the
“Mizerany-Farhatt New Deal Appliance
Company” at 4719 Gravois. During this time,
Steve perfected his advertising style. He would
appear in plaids and stripes that were
outlandish even for the 70’s. Steve took to the
television and radio with enthusiastic
slapstick. On television ads he’d stagger down
the aisles of the New Deal on roller skates. In
his distinctive voice, Steve’s trademark slogan
described the store “at 4719 Gravois, next to
the Bevo Mill” or “4719 Gravois, the Bevo
Mill is next to us!” he implored listeners
“Don’t be confused!” and that the New Deal
was home of the “decent boys” ; and
WHEREAS, Steve used his fame to give
back to the community. During the 1970’s he
helped organize the Annual St. Louis Police
Relief Celebrity Ballgame. Proceeds from
tickets sales were donated to the families of
St. Louis Police Officers killed in the line of
duty, and also to fund the Koinonia Camp for
disabled children. Steve also donated
televisions and appliances to area schools and
churches; and
WHEREAS, Steve is survived by his
three daughters, Catherine Mizerany,
Stephanie Dorris, Veronica Miller, two sons,
Steve Mizerany, Jr. and Vincent Mizerany,

four grandchildren, Blake, Sydney, Stephen
and Grant, and one great grandchild, Alexis.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED BY the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to remember Steve Mizerany and
we further direct the Clerk of this Board to
spread a copy of this Resolution across the
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may
be presented to the family at a time and place
deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
