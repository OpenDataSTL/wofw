FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.
129 and requested that it be referred to the
Public Safety committee for hearing.

Resolution No. 129

WHEREAS, the federal courts recently
banned all executions in Missouri citing that
the present practice causes “unconstitutional
pain and suffering”; and

WHEREAS, the present execution
system in Missouri includes the use of an
anesthesiologist who was found to be dyslexic,
has been banned from practicing medicine in
two hospitals and who has been sued more
than 20 times for malpractice; and
WHEREAS, over the past years the
death penalty system in the State of Missouri
has had numerous complaints of being
capricious and arbitrary resulting in innocent
people being wrongfully convicted and
sentenced to death in Missouri; and
WHEREAS, according to data in a study
of death sentencing in Missouri by Michael
Lenza, a University of Missouri sociologist,
entitled The Prevailing Injustice in the
Application of the Death Penalty in Missouri
(1978-1996) gross disparities are clearly
indicated in the sentencing of minorities with
the death penalty compared to other groups
throughout Missouri in a variety of instances;
and WHEREAS, African-Americans
represent almost half (almost 48%) of those
facing execution in Missouri but comprise
only 11.7% of the state’s population; and
WHEREAS, according to several reports
a large majority of those persons facing capital
charges are indigent can not afford their own
attorney; and
WHEREAS, the State of Missouri now
ranks 4th in the nation in the number of
citizens executed, with only Texas, Virginia
and Oklahoma having executed more people
since the death penalty was reinstated; and
WHEREAS, many Missourians are
calling for an end to state executions and
national polls have consistently shown a
majority support for a moratorium with over
2600 groups nationwide calling for a
moratorium on executions, including over 80
Missouri organizations and faith communities;
and
WHEREAS, there have been numerous
highly publicized cases both nationally and in
Missouri where individuals serving on death
row for years have later been found innocent
which further calls into question the fairness
of this practice, and
WHEREAS, around the country there
have been growing numbers of groups,
organizations and individuals that have
proclaimed the innocence of individuals on
death row with compelling arguments
including movements in support of the
innocence of Larry Griffin, Marlin Gray and
Reggie Clemons, and
WHEREAS, the Circuit Court of the
City of St. Louis has embarked upon an
investigation into the possible wrongful

execution of Larry Griffin, which is an
unprecedented act in this country by a
prosecutor; and

WHEREAS, during the 2005-06
legislative session HB 1496 was introduced
before the Missouri General Assembly calling
for a moratorium on all executions and
establishing a Commission on the Death
Penalty to study the use of the death penalty
in Missouri; and

WHEREAS, in the opinion of many,
fairness and justice compel that the provisions
of HB 1496 be at least reconsidered by the
Missouri General Assembly during the next
legislative session including the assembly
considering a permanent moratorium;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for
the City of St. Louis that we support the
intent of HB 1496 and we call upon the
members of the Missouri General Assembly
to reconsider this legislation as well as consider
a permanent moratorium on all executions in
Missouri.
