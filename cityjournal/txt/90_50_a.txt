President Reed moved that Resolutions
No. 343, 344 and 345 be adopted, at this
meeting of the Board.
Seconded by Ms. Florida.
Carried unanimously by voice vote.

FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS
Mr. Boyd introduced Resolution No.
346 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 346
WHEREAS, currently Missouri Senate
Bill 785 and Missouri House Bill 2117 have
been introduced in the Missouri Senate and
Missouri House respectively which allows
the City of St. Louis to control its police force;
and
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis has
not had local control over its police department
for over 100 years, yet spends nearly one
third of its budget for public safety which
includes the St. Louis Police Department; and
WHEREAS, the principles of local
control over police are consistent with
community policing as espoused by the Saint
Louis Metropolitan Police Department and
with the basic principles of democratic
governance; and
WHEREAS, state control over urban
police departments was a mid-nineteenth
century reform designed to stop corruption
in an era when policing jobs were patronage
positions and also historically grew out of the
power struggles between State and Local
governments of a bygone era; and
WHEREAS, this reform has become
outdated with the advent of professional
policing principles, standardized training,
certification and proper oversight from a
variety civilian agencies and structures; and
WHEREAS, state legislators outside of
the urban areas, St. Louis in particular, have
no constituency concerns with those police
departments and are therefore not held
accountable for their positions and decisions
on these matters and are often unfamiliar with
the details of issues involving urban policing;
and
WHEREAS, typically, appointed
Boards are first accountable to the appointing
authority, which in this case is the Governor
of the State of Missouri, and not the citizens
of the City of St. Louis; and
WHEREAS, in April 1995, 68% of city
voters were in favor of St. Louis police
residency in a non-binding referendum and
again in November 2006 64.56% were in favor

of a residency requirement yet the St. Louis
Board of Police Commissioners still voted to
allow St. Louis Police Officers to live outside
the City of St. Louis illustrating that such
appointed boards are often not sensitive to
the needs and opinions of the local citizenry;
and

WHEREAS, based on the two previous
election results, it is apparent St. Louis
citizens desire a strong relationship and
connection between themselves and the St.
Louis Police Department; and

WHEREAS, Missouri Senate Bill 785
and Missouri House Bill 2117 reflect the
concern for local control by not directing a
particular local police department structure
but allowing St. Louis to design and control
it’s own police force while not including local
control over the police pension fund which
would remain controlled by State legislation
and regulations.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED that the St. Louis Board of
Aldermen support the intent of Missouri
Senate Bill 785 and Missouri House Bill 2117
which would transfer authority over the Saint
Louis Metropolitan Police Department from
the State of Missouri to the city’s local
authorities and that such transfer would
include all powers to pass laws governing the
Saint Louis Metropolitan Police Department
in its policing function, with the exception of
the governance of police pension funds and
the certification of police officers as currently
controlled by the State and we further
encourage the Missouri Senate and House of
Representatives to pass the proposed
legislation which would enable local control.
