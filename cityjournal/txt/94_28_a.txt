President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 202 through 205 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 202

100th Anniversary of St. Roch Church
WHEREAS, the first homes in Skinker
DeBaliviere were built in 1908. Just three
years later, some of the early residents formed
the parish of St. Roch; and

WHEREAS, the residents met in a
storefront on Kingsbury and by 1921 they
were able to lay the cornerstone on the
magnificent edifice that is a center of the
neighborhood. The church and its school served
the large neighborhood Catholic population;
and

WHEREAS, the church became a critical
linchpin of the neighborhood after integration
and subsequent white flight. Although some
parishioners joined that flight, a strong coterie
remained loyal to parish and neighborhood
and helped to stabilize the area. The school
expanded and opened to non-Catholics. The
church and its pastors worked with Grace
Methodist and Delmar Baptist and
Washington University to create the council
and help fund it and to provide a base for a
myriad of neighborhood activities; and
WHEREAS, today, the church and
school remain vital to Skinker DeBaliviere.
After one hundred years, the church and its
parishioners are at the heart of what this
neighborhood is; and
WHEREAS, St. Roch parishioners and
school alumni will be participating in activities
marking this major milestone. On Sunday,
September 25, 2011 a special mass will be
said with the archbishop in attendance. A
celebratory dinner will follow at the Chase.
There will be a video capturing the impact of
St. Roch and a book to be forthcoming later. A
joyous celebration to the members of St. Roch
and to its pastor of 30 years, Monsignor Sal
Polizzi; and
WHEREAS, St. Roch has educated
thousands of St. Louis’s children and has been
a setting for thousands of baptisms, weddings,
First Communions, Confirmations and
funerals; and
WHEREAS, St. Roch is a source of
spiritual solace for Catholics and nonCatholics alike; it is dependable, unshakeable
pillar of the neighborhood during turbulent

times.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we wish to recognize
St. Roch Church on the occasion of their One
Hundredth Anniversary, that we encourage
them to continue in their commitment to the
community, and we wish it many more years
of success; and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of this proceeding and to
prepare a commemorative copy for
presentation to our honorees at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the sponsor.

The 8th annual Fuzzball with the Fuzz
Benefit Tournament
WHEREAS, on October 9, 2011,
members of the St. Louis Police Department
will be hosting the 8th Annual Fuzzball with
the Fuzz Benefit Tournament; and
WHEREAS, each year this tournament
benefits a different person or family in need,
or an organization committed to a worthy
cause and each year the event has grown; and
WHEREAS, the previous seven
“Fuzzball with the Fuzz” tournaments have
raised a total of more than $51,000 for their
various beneficiaries which have included
injured officers, the families of officers killed
in the line of duty and as the result of offduty accidents, ill officers and their family
members, members of our community and
United States Marines injured in combat
overseas; and
WHEREAS, This year the tournament
has selected two of St. Louis’ finest, Officer
Joe Haman and Officer Lucas Roethlisberger.
Officer Joe Haman was shot several times
during a traffic stop at Grand and Natural
Bridge on May 27, 2010. Joe is a former
Marine and Iraq War veteran. He was the 5th
District’s Police Officer of the Year in 2009.
Officer Lucas Roethlisberger was shot in the
neck and elbow on October 14, 2010 during a
traffic stop at Enright and Bayard. Officer
Roethlisberger was named the department’s
Overall Officer of the Year for 2010. Both
these young men are highly motivated and
productive officers. Each of them continues
to work very hard to return to duty. They
have been without the ability to work overtime
and secondary to help provide for their
families for an extended period of time; and
WHEREAS, This year’s event will be

held at Woerner School at 6131 Leona on
Sunday, October 9th, 2011 at 9:00 a.m.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the many
contributions of the 8th Annual Fuzzball with
the Fuzz Benefit Tournament to the City of
St. Louis and we further direct the Clerk of
