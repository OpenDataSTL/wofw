COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 290 and 291 and the Clerk was instructed
to read same.

Resolution No. 290
Darryl Burton
WHEREAS, we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the prison release
of Darryl Burton; and
WHEREAS, the trial error that freed
Darryl Burton from a 1985 murder conviction
in St. Louis would never happen in the
computer age, according to a top prosecutor;
and
WHEREAS, a key prosecution witness,
who is now in prison for an unrelated murder,
lied in a way that minimized his own criminal
record at Burton’s trial, and neither the
prosecution nor the defense challenged it; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Burton claimed from
the start that he did not shoot Donald Ball,
26, who was slain shortly before 10 p.m. June
4, 1984, as he pumped gas at an Amoco station
at Goodfellow and Delmar Boulevards. “I’ve
got 24 years behind the eight ball; it was hell
on Earth,” Burton said at a news conference
in Kansas City, where he plans to live with
cousins. “Prison’s a stressful place, especially
when you’re innocent and no one believes
you;” and
WHEREAS, Mr. Burton had filed a
flurry of state and federal appeals over the
years and got nowhere until Centurion
Ministries accepted his case in 2000 and
helped finance an investigation. “Everything
I was doing fell on deaf ears,” Burton said.
“I’m from the ghetto ... and me and my family,
we’ve been harmed and the real perpetrator is
moving on down the road.” Burton claims he

was not near the gas station that day, and
there was no physical evidence to the contrary;
and

WHEREAS, after 25 years, Mr. Burton
was reunited with his daughter, Tynesha Lee.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
recognize Mr. Darryl Burton and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a copy for
presentation, at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 291

Carolyn Hewes Toft
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
after 32 years of dedicated service to St. Louis,
as Executive Director of Landmarks
Association of St. Louis, Carolyn Hewes Toft
has recently retired; and

WHEREAS, Carolyn has been an
advocate for historic preservation, excellence
in contemporary architecture and sound urban
planning for 32 years. Before coming to St.
Louis in 1970, she lived in a variety of diverse
locations including Norman, Oklahoma;
Lincoln, Nebraska; Madison, Wisconsin;
Heidelberg, Germany; Castro Valley,
California, and Cleveland Heights, Ohio. All
of those experiences plus an insatiable
wanderlust have contributed to her
appreciation of St. Louis’ cultural heritage;
and

WHEREAS, Carolyn holds two degrees

Iowa, and MM, University of Wisconsin,
Madison) in addition to a Master’s degree in
Urban Studies from Washington University
in St. Louis where she continues to teach parttime in the School of Architecture; and

WHEREAS, she is the author or coauthor of numerous publications about St.
Louis architecture and has conducted
countless tours of her adopted city. In 1990,
Carolyn was one of ten individuals in the
country to be awarded honorary membership
in the American Institute of Architects; and

WHEREAS, Board President Bill
Wischmeyer praised the former director saying
“it is fair to say that Carolyn Toft has
effectively been Landmarks Association for
as long as anyone can remember. Due to her
guidance and direction, the association has
grown to a membership of over 1,500 and is
recognized throughout the country as one of

the nation’s premier
organizations;” and

preservation

WHEREAS, Toft’s accomplishments
while director of Landmarks are numerous and
reflect her determination, thoroughness and
passion. One of her greatest accomplishments
was securing the passage of Missouri’s
historic rehabilitation tax credits law, one of
the state’s most important economic
development tools. Her most recent
accomplishment was the creation of
Architecture St. Louis, a center to promote
St. Louis’ architectural heritage and encourage
sound planning.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to congratulate Carolyn Hewes
Toft for 32 years of service to St. Louis, as
Executive Director of Landmarks Association
of St. Louis and we wish her peace and
happiness in her retirement and we direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
