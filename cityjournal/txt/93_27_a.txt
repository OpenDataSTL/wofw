Resolution No. 180

Salt Covenant Baptist Church
WHEREAS, from the humble
beginnings, the Salt Covenant Baptist Church
has been a beneficiary of grace and mercy of
the Lord since its inception on July 15, 2007.
Rev. Chaz T. Jaquess, the Founding Pastor,

the St. Louis Metropolitan area, Hillsdale, to
tell men and women, boys and girls that they
must be born again; and

WHEREAS, aside from receiving the
clarion call to preach the gospel, Rev. Jaquess
was an engineer for Alberici Constructors, Inc.
since the late 90’s. With the assistance of Mr.

Jaquess received the stamp of approval to
hold the first service in the cafeteria of the old
Alberici Constructors, Inc. Headquarters

Moreover, over 120 sons and daughters and
counting have confessed their ministry during
his pastorate; and
WHEREAS, to date, Salt Covenant has
been and continues to be determined to move
upward and onward to the Light. At a
minimum, the Church offers a full service
worship experience, holistic ministry, spiritual
and personal development opportunities, and
community involvement and support. A
functioning Media Ministry is now underway.
And finally, the Church is on the brink of a
transitional moment of receiving the blessing
of a new home. Now celebrating three years
of helping people get to where God wants
them to be, Salt’s work has just begun.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

the TDD Act, the Sales Tax may be imposed
at a rate in increments of one-eighth of one

Sales Tax shall not apply to the sale or use of

current, water and gas, natural or artificial,

nor to sales of service to telephone
subscribers, either local or long distance.
Pursuant to Section 238.235.1 of the TDD
Act, the board of directors of the proposed
district will be requested to adopt a resolution
imposing such Sales Tax at a rate not to exceed
one percent (1.0%) and will request that the
Sales Tax be submitted to the qualified voters
for approval. By unanimous petition of the
owners of all property within the District,
the owners shall provide their unanimous
consent and approval with respect to whether
the District shall impose a sales tax within the
District at the rate of up to one percent (1.0%)
for up to 40 years. The Petitioners desire to
seek voter approval of the imposition of the
TDD Sales Tax at a rate not to exceed one
percent (1.0%), to (i) pay costs of financing
or refinancing the Transportation Project, (ii)
reimburse the Petitioners for the costs of filing
and defending this Petition as authorized by
Section 238.217 of the TDD Act, (iii) pay the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on

repayment of obligations issued with respect
to the redevelopment of the real property
located within the District, at least a portion
of which shall be issued on behalf of the District
with respect to the Transportation Project.
21. The proposed District will not be
an undue burden on any owner of property
within the District and is not unjust or
unreasonable.
22. The District’s proposed budgeted
expenditures,
including
estimated
expenditures for real physical improvements,
estimated land acquisition expenses, estimated
expenses for professional services and
estimated interest charges, is set forth in
Exhibit D, a copy of which is attached hereto
and incorporated herein by this reference.
DISSOLUTION OF THE DISTRICT
AND REPEAL OF THE SALES TAX
23. Petitioners, as owners of record of
all real property located within the proposed
District, may file a petition with the Court
seeking to dissolve the District prior to the
meeting at which the board of directors of the
District will be elected. After election of the
board of directors of the District, the District
shall be dissolved only in compliance with
Section 238.275 of the TDD Act.
24. In no event shall the Sales Tax be
repealed, in whole or in part, nor the District

be dissolved, until payment in full and
satisfaction of all transportation development
revenue bonds, transportation development
revenue notes or other obligations, singly or
in series, issued by the District in furtherance
of the Transportation Project, except in
accordance with the TDD Act.
