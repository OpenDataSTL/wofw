Resolution No. 310
The Lucky Eleven Athletic Club
WHEREAS, the Lucky Eleven A.C. was
founded by a group of 13 and 14-year old
boys involved in various sandlot sports in the
year 1935. Having no place to hold meetings,
they dug a two-room cave in the side of a hill
off the 8000 block of Polk Street in
Carondelet. Forced to vacate the club cave by
the owner of the ground (Missouri Pacific
Railroad), the members held meetings in
members’ homes and later rented space in the
300 block of Marceau Street and then on
South Broadway near Catalan Street. To help
defray cost of uniforms and equipment the
team would “pass the hat” at their ball games,
hold raffles, pay dues and other activities; and
WHEREAS, on February 26, 1938, the
members held their first annual dance at Rosati
Hall, 7100 Michigan Avenue. Other dances
followed at the Mehlville Farmers Club, the
Laverne Hall, 6307 Michigan Avenue and
Sauters’ Nite Club (with a floor show and
dance featuring Corbett Monica, who later
became a show-biz celebrity); and
WHEREAS, baseball, football, softball,
bowling, training youngsters to box and the
annual dances kept the club active until the
boys went in to the service in WW II. Upon
their return in early 1946, they reorganized.
Among other league championships, was the
St. Louis Amateur Softball Championship
(ASA) in 1955; and
WHEREAS, today’s club house was
built “by the members” from an army barracks
purchased as war surplus from Jefferson
Barracks on Halsey Street. It was dismantled,
stored for a year until ground could be
purchased. It was later rebuilt and improved
on their present nine-acre site. All work was
done by the club members who continue to
maintain and improve on the building and
grounds; and
WHEREAS, the members enjoy good
fellowship at their twice-a-month meetings,
their once-a-month dinner at the club prepared
by a selected group of members, various
parties, such as the Annual Christmas Party,
the Annual Turkey Dinner and the Annual
Breakfast for the ladies. Other events enjoyed
by the members are the Annual Bowling
Tournament and the Annual Triathalon
featuring bowling, golf and horseshoes; and

WHEREAS, the founding members
were: Charlie and Frank Intagliata, Chester
Bollinger, Bill Bunch, Kerm Flicker, John and
Ed O’Donnell, Bernie Flanagan, “Ding”
Mueller, “Flash” Muscovalley, Lou and
Harvey Tayon, Bill Moentmann and Bud
Klittich. Three of the founding members are
alive and still active in the club, Fran Intagliata,
John O’Donnell and Kerm Ficker. Joe
Hanrahan, Alderwoman Hanrahan’s dad, was
a long-time member before serving in WW II.;
and

WHEREAS, more than 250 have at one
time or other been members of the Lucky
Eleven Athletic Club. At the club’s founding,
the members lived within 10 blocks from each
other. Today’s members now come from St.
Louis City, Lemay, Affton, Arnold, Barnhart,
Osage Beach, Imperial, Fenton, Moscow
Mills, Ellisville, Bonne Terre and Festus.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the Lucky Eleven
Athletic Club for its many years of success
and achievement and we direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
