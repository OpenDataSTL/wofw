WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Peter Sortino, a foundation stone of our city,
has achieved that monumental milestone of
50 years of age; and

WHEREAS, Peter followed the phrase
of “Go west, young man, Go west” and landed
on our banks in 1977 establishing his base in
the outpost of Soulard, and embarking on his
acclaimed career as an urban planner with
Urban Programming Corporation. Using his
planning skills Peter threw himself into the
redevelopment of the neighborhood, driving
the alleys at 5 AM, counting revolving electric
meters to determine the occupancy of units,
and pushing the development of the
neighborhood. Showing his own commitment
he and his loving wife, Leslie, purchased their
own piece of heaven and rehabilitated a
derelict building into a gracious home for
entertaining, which they did quite well; and

WHEREAS , Peter needed another
challenge and entered the world of government
and politics. He developed and exhibited his
political finesse managing campaigns, knocking
on doors, twisting arms, negotiating strategies
on a number of issues and a variety of
candidates. He used his planning skills to
direct the ConServe Office under Schoemehl
and his political skills as Director of
Governmental Affairs for the Bosley
administration. Peter had the respect of all
members of the Board Of Alderman, and he
pushed forward the administration’s agenda

in Jefferson City by phoning his employee to
wake him each day, give him the day’s agenda,
and follow-up each evening; and
WHEREAS, Peter left the hallowed halls
to assist in developing and carrying out the
regions goals for a 2004 celebration, and he
has since risen to leadership in this effort. He
spearheaded the campaign to establish a
Metropolitan Parks Tax throughout the bistate area. He brought together numerous
groups to design, implement and fund the
construction of the steps at the Arch grounds,
and to provide a summer’s worth of
entertainment on the river including EATS
Bridge. He has quietly but efficiently
supported numerous projects in the
community, and he continues to work on the
overwhelming need for affordable healthcare
in our community; and
WHEREAS, all along the way Peter has
developed his imitations, and pet names for
those he has met, and he can remember events
and enhance tales to entertain for hours. But
he has always earned the respect of those
around him because he treats them fairly and
respects their positions while imposing his
rules;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Peter Sortino on the
occasion of this 50th birthday and we thank
him, on behalf of the citizens of the City of
St. Louis, for his many contributions to this
community and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to prepare a commemorative copy
of this Resolution to the end that it may be
presented to our honoree at a time and place
deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS
Mr. Bosley introduced Resolution No.
92 and requested that it be assigned to the
Committee on Health & Human Services for
hearing.

Resolution No. 92
WHEREAS, to improve the health and
safety of individuals seeking medical care in

the City of St. Louis, such care must be
available throughout the city through a
comprehensive and high-quality health care
system; and
WHEREAS, access to a full spectrum
of hospital services and to highly trained
physicians in all specialties is essential to
improve patient health and safety; and
WHEREAS, to maintain this system,
medical liability insurance must be obtainable
at an affordable and reasonable rate; and

WHEREAS, in recent years medical
liability insurance has escalated at an
unimaginable rate due, in large part, to the
massive monetary judgements being awarded
in medical malpractice lawsuits throughout the
country; and

WHEREAS, experienced and highly
qualified physicians in the City of St. Louis
are leaving the practice of medicine everyday
due to the high cost of medical liability
insurance and the increasing threat of lawsuits;
and

WHEREAS , without reasonable
changes in the legal system in this State, which
must include a monetary cap on medical
malpractice claims, this City will continue to
lose valuable medical services and be unable
to provide medical care for those who are in
the greatest need;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we support tort
law reform in the State of Missouri and urge
the Missouri General Assembly to once again
consider legislation to lower medical liability
insurance rates and place reasonable
limitations on medical malpractice lawsuits.
