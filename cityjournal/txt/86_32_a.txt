Resolution No. 190

WHEREAS, the slow pace by which
the City of St. Louis demolishes buildings
which have been condemned continues to be a
source of frustration and concern to the
residents of this City as well as the members
of this Board of Aldermen; and

WHEREAS, the demolition process,

cumbersome and time consuming and results
in the continuing presence of dangerous and
unusable buildings and structures within our
neighborhoods which have a negative impact

on residential and commercial development

for demolitions becomes a secondary concern
if the process by which buildings and
structures are demolished is inadequate and
ineffectual; and

demolition contracts are awarded is well within
the purview of the Public Safety Committee;

Board of Aldermen Committee report,
October 31, 2003.
To the President of the Board of
Aldermen:
The Committee on Public Utilities to
whom was referred the following Resolution,
report that they have considered the same and
recommend adoption.

Resolution No. 156

WHEREAS, freedom of expression and
diversity of opinion are essential to
democracy; and

WHEREAS, the mandate of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) is to
foster diversity, localism, and competition in
the U.S. broadcast system; and

WHEREAS, the FCC on June 2, 2003,
voted 3-2 to change its rules on media
ownership to allow a company (1) to own
television stations that can reach a higher
percentage of the national audience, (2) to
increase the number of stations it owns in a
given area, and (3) to allow a company to own
television stations and newspapers in the same
market; and
WHEREAS, the FCC’s action removes
safeguards against undue concentration of
media ownership, inevitably reducing the
number of independent voices and decreasing
the amount of locally produced and locally
relevant news and programming; and
WHEREAS, concentration of media
ownership and production diminishes general
public’s ability to have access to a wide range
of views and information; and
WHEREAS, without a diversity of
opinion, the ability of citizens to receive
materials and information presenting all points
of view on current and historical issues to
their communities is diminished, therefore be
it; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis is greatly concerned with
the action of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) of June 2, 2003, and voices
in the strongest possible terms opposition to
these changes in the media ownership rules
that encourage further concentration of the
media;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we support
Congressional legislation to void the FCC’s
regulatory action, including S.1046, the
“Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity,
and Competition in Television Broadcast Act
of 2003,”and support Congressional efforts
to reduce media concentration in the United
States, and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the
Clerk of this Board shall this resolution be
forwarded to the Federal Communications
Commission, to Members of Missouri
Congressional Delegation, and to others as
appropriate.
