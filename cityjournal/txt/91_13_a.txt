the classical beauty of this piece; and

lived in Rome, where she lived and worked
with many famous intellectuals of that time
including the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning
who proclaimed her “a perfectly emancipated
female.”; and
WHEREAS, in 1858 the Missouri
legislature decided to commission a statute to
honor the late Senator Thomas Hart Benton
and Hatty was selected to sculpt the first
public monument in Missouri as well as the
first public monument west of the
Mississippi.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the 140th
Anniversary of the dedication of the Benton
Monument in Lafayette Park and the many
accomplishments of the talented and
determined Harriet Hosmer and we direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to further prepare a
commemorative copy to the end that it may

be presented to our honoree at a time and
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
