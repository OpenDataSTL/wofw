no members, no support, and with only a key
to the front door. He single handedly prepared
the church for his first worship service on
September 16, 1956. In addition to
performing manual labor, he visited door to

and at Johnson C. Smith Seminary in
Charlotte, North Carolina. For many years,
he has served as Chairman of the Board of
Mathews-Dickey Boy’s and Girl’s Club and
on the Board of Regents of Harris-Stowe State
University. A senior citizens residence,
scholarship program and a residence hall at
Harris-Stowe State University have all named

enjoyed his work and performed his duties
with highest dedication. He is highly regarded
as a speaker and counselor, and he is respected
and revered by theologians throughout the
nation. He is a man of peace, humility, and
honor. He is truly an example of a Christian
gentleman. Rev. Gillespie has succeeded and
excelled in all his endeavor and the community
has benefited greatly because of his Christian
example.
