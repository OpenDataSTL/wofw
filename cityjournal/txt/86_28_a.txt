FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS
Mr. Smith introduced Resolution
No. 154 and requested that it be assigned to
the Committee on Public Employees for
hearing.

Resolution No. 154
WHEREAS, in recent weeks, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, in
response to a complaint filed by Fire Institute
for Racial Equality, released a finding that the
promotions test used by the St. Louis City
Fire Department to promote captains and
battalion chiefs had a “significant adverse
impact” on minority candidates; and
WHEREAS, as a result of this finding,
the EEOC has made an offer of settlement to
the City of St. Louis which was intended to

settle the complaint and prevent the matter
from being referred to the Justice Department
for further action; and

WHEREAS,
on
Thursday,
September 25, 2003, the City of St. Louis,
through City Counselor Patti Hageman,
rejected the proposed settlement and refused
to make any counter offer to resolve the
firefighter’s complaint; and

WHEREAS, this unfortunate and illadvised response by the City will further
alienate minority firefighters, increase racial
tension within the fire department and, most
likely, embroil the City in another federal
lawsuit involving the promotional testing
within the department; and

WHEREAS, every effort should be
made to resolve this issue without further
animosity and remove the lingering questions
regarding the fairness of promotional testing
within the St. Louis City Fire Department;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we encourage the
City Counselor to reopen negotiations with
the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in order to continue the
discussion of settlement proposals regarding
the Commission’s findings and we further urge
a quick and fair resolution to this matter.
Introduced the 3rd day of October, 2003 by:
Honorable Irene J. Smith, Alderwoman 1st Ward

Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.
156 and requested that it be assigned to the
Committee on Public Utilities for hearing.

Resolution No. 156

WHEREAS, freedom of expression and
diversity of opinion are essential to
democracy; and

WHEREAS, the mandate of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) is to
foster diversity, localism, and competition in
the U.S. broadcast system; and

WHEREAS, the FCC on June 2, 2003,
voted 3-2 to change its rules on media
ownership to allow a company (1) to own
television stations that can reach a higher
percentage of the national audience, (2) to
increase the number of stations it owns in a
given area, and (3) to allow a company to own
television stations and newspapers in the same
market; and

WHEREAS, the FCC’s action removes
safeguards against undue concentration of
media ownership, inevitably reducing the
number of independent voices and decreasing
the amount of locally produced and locally
relevant news and programming; and

WHEREAS, concentration of media
ownership and production diminishes general
public’s ability to have access to a wide range
of views and information; and

WHEREAS, without a diversity of
opinion, the ability of citizens to receive
materials and information presenting all points
of view on current and historical issues to
their communities is diminished, therefore be
it; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis is greatly concerned with
the action of the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) of June 2, 2003, and voices
in the strongest possible terms opposition to
these changes in the media ownership rules
that encourage further concentration of the
media;

NOW
THEREFORE
BE
IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis that we support
Congressional legislation to void the FCC’s
regulatory action, including S.1046, the
“Preservation of Localism, Program Diversity,
and Competition in Television Broadcast Act
of 2003,”and support Congressional efforts
to reduce media concentration in the United
States, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the
Clerk of this Board shall this resolution be
forwarded to the Federal Communications
Commission, to Members of Missouri
Congressional Delegation, and to others as
appropriate.

Introduced the 3rd day of October, 2003 by:
Honorable Terry Kennedy, Alderman 18th Ward
Ms. Smith introduced Resolution No.
160 and requested that it be assigned to the
Committee on Streets, Traffic & Refuse for
hearing.

Resolution No. 160
WHEREAS, during the deliberations
regarding the city’s budget for the current fiscal
year, the members of this Board, with the
subsequent approval of the Board of Estimate
and Apportionment, appropriated sufficient
funds to maintain the previous year’s
frequency of residential street cleaning; and
WHEREAS, in recent weeks, the Street
Department has notified the residents of this
city that the frequency of street cleaning will
be dramatically reduced; and
WHEREAS, any reduction in residential
street cleaning will greatly impact the quality
of life in our neighborhoods and is directly
opposed to the stated position of this board
in regard to such street cleaning; and

WHEREAS, it is within the purview of
this board to investigate any reduction in tax
payer supported services in this city and to
make every effort to ensure that these essential
services remain available to our citizens;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we direct the
Committee on Streets, Traffic and Refuse to
convene a hearing for the purpose of
determining the reason(s) for the decrease in
street cleaning services and to report their
findings to the full board. The Committee on
Streets, Traffic and Refuse is hereby
authorized to issue subpoenas to compel the
testimony of witnesses and the production of
records as may be required to accomplish the
stated purpose of this resolution.
