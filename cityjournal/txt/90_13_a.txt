OF RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Wessels introduced Resolution No.
73 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 73

WHEREAS, during a period of rising
prosperity, the nation’s home builders have
reached out to offer the opportunity of
homeownership to an increasingly wide
segment of the nation’s families; and

WHEREAS, the lower mortgage interest
rates that are available today are making it
easier for young working families to become
homeowners; and

WHEREAS, the opportunity to own a
home and live in decent housing is the strength
of the nation and the source of the spirit of
civic-mindedness that shapes the caring and
nurturing of communities where our citizens
live; and

WHEREAS, the nation’s home builders
have contributed mightily to America’s quest
for affordable homeownership opportunities
by pursing greater efficiencies and innovations
in building techniques and materials; and
WHEREAS, home builders today offer
the American consumer a product that is
geared for affordability and the level of quality
that home buyers expect; and
WHEREAS, data shows that an increase
of just $1,000 in the cost of a new home means
that an additional 250,000 American families
are unable to purchase a home, costly
regulatory barriers through certain public
policies must be closely examined for both
their positive and negative impact on the
community.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize June as National
Homeownership Month and call upon the

citizens of this City to observe this month
and call upon their government to restore
housing as a national priority, and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these

69 be adopted, at this meeting of the Board.
Seconded by Mr. Ortmann.
Carried unanimously by voice vote.

Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.
51 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 51

Whereas: The City of Saint Louis
spends nearly one third of its budget for public
safety which includes the St. Louis Police
Department, and

Whereas: The City of St. Louis has not
had control over its police department for over
100 years, and

Whereas: The cities of Saint Louis and
Kansas City are the only two cities of their
category in the nation which do not have local
control over their police; and

Whereas: The principles of local control
over police are consistent with community
policing as espoused by the Saint Louis
Metropolitan Police Department and with the
basic principles of democratic governance; and

Whereas: State control over urban police
departments was a mid-nineteenth century
reform designed to stop corruption in an era
when policing jobs were patronage positions
and also historically grew out of he power
struggles of a bygone era; and

Whereas: This reform has become
outdated with the advent of professional
policing principles, standardized training,
certification and proper oversight from a
variety civilian agencies and structures; and

Whereas: State legislators outside of the
urban areas, St. Louis in particular, have no
constituency concerned with those police
departments and are therefore not held
accountable for their positions and decisions
on these matters and are often unfamiliar with
the details of issues involving urban policing;
and

Whereas: Typically, appointed Boards
are first accountable to the appointing
authority which in this case is the Governor
of the State of Missouri and not the citizens

of the City of St. Louis and does not seemingly
provide enough incentive for such an
appointed board to solicit the opinions from
Saint Louis citizens and be finally accountable
to those citizens as illustrated by recent
decisions regarding police residency; and

Whereas: Several state legislators have
sponsored measures to return control of the
St. Louis police department to the citizens of
St. Louis;

Therefore Now Let it Be it resolved that
the Saint Louis Board of Aldermen supports
the transfer of authority over the Saint Louis
Metropolitan Police Department from the
State of Missouri to that city’s local authorities
and that such transfer would include all
powers to pass laws governing the Saint Louis
Metropolitan Police Department in its policing
function, with the exception of the governance
of police pension funds and the certification
of police officers as currently controlled by
the State.
