Resolution No. 192
Apostle Ariette Jefferson-Williams
WHEREAS, Ariette Jefferson was called
to effective ministry at the early age of eight.
Standing before congregations of all sizes, she
captured the attention of many and was well
respected by all. Once you saw her in action,
you were completely convinced that she was
born just to do ministry. At the mature age of
sixteen, Ariette was ordained a minister. At a
time when women were not accepted as
preachers, she stayed faithful to God no matter
how others viewed her. Minister Jefferson
was well known for knowing how to have
some “real church.” The kind of church where
the Holy Spirit moved from the devotional
“Hallelujah” to the benediction “May the Lord
Watch”; and
WHEREAS, the cards of life that
Minister Jefferson was dealt were cards that
would make you or break you, sometimes up
and other times down. Many times looking
around she found herself alone, heartbroken,
sad, and depressed because of life’s tough love.
Despite family hurt and church hurt she kept
her eyes on Christ even while others called

her crazy; and
WHEREAS, nineteen years ago God
blessed Ariette to be the missing rib of Minister
James E. Williams. Mr. and Mrs. Williams are
the proud parents of four anointed sons. They
are also the blessed grandparents of twentyfive grandchildren and glowing about the two
great-grandchildren. Apostle Williams has been
a quartet singer for over twenty-nine years
and a radio announcer for over twelve years;
and
WHEREAS, Apostle Williams is known
for being a real, loving, and generous person.
She will and has given the shirt off her back
just to be a blessing to her fellow brothers and
sisters. This great love that was imparted into
her at birth prepared her for the mantle of
Pastoralship ten years ago. The Lord God
spoke to her clearly and said “You Will Pastor”
and gave her the name of the church. She
obeyed the voice of the Lord and started the
church with only four people. Ten years later
the Oil of God International Ministries, Inc.,
is yet stronger than ever, healthy, and serves
as the spiritual hospital to many within the
community; and
WHEREAS, Apostle Williams is leading
a growing congregation with a vision right in
the heart of our city. The Oil of God
International Ministries, Inc. is empowered
to change a generation with the true Word of
God. Proclaiming Jesus Christ as the Head of
the Church and the manifested Word. Their
goal is to reach those that are hurting, torn,
broken, bitter, saddened, and in search of a
better way of living.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
recognize the many contributions and
congratulate Apostle Ariette JeffersonWilliams and we further direct the Clerk of
this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution
across the minutes of these proceedings and
to prepare a commemorative copy for
presentation at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 193
Mr. John Wesley Taylor, Jr.
WHEREAS, Mr. John Wesley Taylor,
Jr. was born January 6, 1930 in Elliot,
Mississippi, to the union of John Wesley
Taylor, Sr., and Bettie Mae Brown Taylor.
He was the oldest of ten children, six girls and
four boys. John had professed his faith in
Christ at an early age and joined the Galilee
Baptist Church when his family moved to St.

Louis, Missouri from Mississippi; and

WHEREAS, he was educated in the St.
Louis Public School System and proudly
graduated from Vashon High School. He
attended Hubbard Business College in St.
Louis, Missouri, educating himself with a
business foundation to follow into the
footsteps of the family business - Taylor
Sausage Company. He served in the United
States Army receiving an Honorable Discharge
for his service. His business education and
commitment to family led him into the family
business.

WHEREAS, Taylor Sausage Company
is one of the oldest black-owned businesses
in St. Louis - with its beginnings in 1938. John
was quickly catapulted into leadership and
became president of the company following
the untimely death of his father, John Wesley
Taylor, Sr. In 1963. He supported his mother
Bettie Mae Brown Taylor, the CEO of the
company taking the leadership of the
company known by its slogan “Hog enough
to want your business, man enough to treat
you right.” The sausage products were sold
in major grocery chains and neighborhood
stores within St. Louis and Illinois; and

WHEREAS, John married Mary Ann
Walker on January 2, 1955 and raised five
children to this union. He loved life and family
and enjoyed many family reunions, birthday
parties, and his legendary Memorial Day
picnic which always featured live music
comprised of talented family musicians. John
enjoyed football and especially following the
Herbert Hoover Boys and Girls Club Football
“Eagles” and the Cardinal Ritter College Prep
Football “Lions” as recently as the Friday
before his death. He was very proud of his
children and grandchildren, boasting with joy
to all he met; and

WHEREAS, John was committed to his
community and was vocal to make a difference
of supporting the school district Parent
Teacher Congress as President, Yeatman
Health Board member and serving on the
Missouri Mental Health Board and was
inducted into the 2007 St. Louis Gateway
Classic Sports Foundation Walk of Fame
Honoree because of his strong character and
lifelong commitment of community service and
business dedication. He was a proud member
of Vashon High School Class of 1949, carrying
their legacy until his death. He also served as
president of the Lamb’s Inc., a civic
organization providing funds for multiple
children’s groups and a life member of Prince
Hall Grand Lodge; and

WHEREAS, golf was a passionate
pastime in John’s life; very competitive
through the years he won more than his fair

share of local tournaments. His friends nicknamed him Sausage Taylor, known throughout
the St. Louis area and traveled in to golf
tournaments near and far with his family in
tow; and
WHEREAS, John’s motto was “I did it
my way” and that was not lost on his children.
From the early years he was very instrumental
in their upbringing whether taking them out
on his delivery routes or taking them across
18 holes of golf. Graduation from college was
not the exception, but the rule and nothing
less than that was allowed. He walked tall
and carried a big stick on instilling in his
children a strong work ethic and moral
character; and
WHEREAS, early Monday morning
September 27, 2010 John transitioned
peacefully into eternal rest. He was preceded
in death by his father John Wesley Taylor,
Sr., mother Bettie Mae Brown Taylor, five
sisters: Ernestine Taylor, Wilma Staton,
Evelyn McKinley, Peggy Ann Taylor, and
Lorene Ray; and two brothers, Lead and

to mention he was sensitive to the things of
God. Rahmel had a sense of humor that will
