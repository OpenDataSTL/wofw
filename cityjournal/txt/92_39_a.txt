RESOLUTIONS
– INFORMAL CALENDAR

Ms. Triplett introduced Resolution No.
10 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 10

Cleanup of the West Lake Landfill
WHEREAS, 66 years ago, the United
States government began processing uranium
for the development of nuclear weapons at
the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (MCW),
near Downtown St. Louis. From 1946 until
1957 the radioactive wastes were trucked to a
23-acre tract at the St. Louis Airport on Brown
Road (now McDonnell Blvd.) on the banks
of Coldwater Creek, and were dumped there;
and

WHEREAS, some of those wastes were
later trucked to Latty Avenue in Hazelwood
for drying and shipping to Colorado for
reprocessing, with dispersal resulting along
the haul roads; and

WHEREAS, in 1973 some of the Latty
Avenue wastes were illegally dumped at the
West Lake Municipal Waste Landfill in
Bridgeton, next to Earth City, in the Missouri
River floodplain; and

WHEREAS, in 1997 Congress
transferred responsibility from the U.S.
Department of Energy to the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers for the remediation of the nation’s
abandoned sites where work had been
performed for the early atomic weapons
program; and

WHEREAS, the Corps has been

directing the cleanup of all the sites containing
MCW radioactive wastes in St. Louis City
and County, under the Formerly Utilized Sites
Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), except
for the West Lake Landfill, and expects to
continue employing its trained contractors and
personnel in St. Louis for an additional four
to five years; and

WHEREAS, because the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had
placed West Lake on its Superfund National
Priorities List in 1990, it therefore had assumed
responsibility for the landfill’s wastes and
remediation; and

WHEREAS, the EPA issued a Record
of Decision in May 2008 about West Lake,
dictating that the radioactive wastes were to
remain in the landfill, with merely a cover of
rocks, construction rubble, and clay, and no
liner below to protect the wastes from
groundwater leaching; and

WHEREAS, residents in St. Louis
County north of I-70 and most St. Louis City
residents drink water from the Missouri River,
downstream from West Lake.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we request that
Congress transfer jurisdiction over the cleanup
of West Lake radioactive wastes (Operable
Unit One) from the EPA Superfund Program
to the Corps of Engineers’ FUSRAP and that
those wastes be excavated and shipped to a
licensed radioactive waste disposal site.
Furthermore, the Board of Aldermen of the
City of St. Louis urges all those involved in
the cleanup of the West Lake radioactive
wastes to ensure that these wastes no longer
migrate into the human environment, to the
detriment of today’s and future generations.

Introduced on the 1st day of May, 2009 by:

HonorableTerry KennedyAlderman 18th Ward
Honorable Gregory CarterAlderman 27th Ward
