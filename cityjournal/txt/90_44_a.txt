Resolution No. 318
HOME MORTGAGE RESOLUTION
WHEREAS, the onrushing financial
crisis involving home mortgages, debt
instruments of all types, and the banking
system of the United States threatens to set
off an economic collapse worse than the Great
Depression of the 1930s; and
WHEREAS, millions of Americans are
faced with foreclosure and loss of their homes
over the coming months; and
WHEREAS, the hedge funds which
spread this financial collapse among markets
worldwide by dominating speculation in all
those markets are now going bankrupt and
demanding government bailout of their
securities and derivatives, and the nominal
value of the derivatives based on mortgages
alone is the size of the combined GDP of the
nations of the world; and
WHEREAS, this financial crisis
threatens the integrity of both federal and
state chartered banks, as typified by the run
on deposits of Countrywide Financial
Corporation in California on August 16, 2007,
which could wipe out the life savings of too
many American people and drastically
undermine the economic stability of our states
and cities; and
WHEREAS,
under
similar
circumstances in the 1930s, President Franklin
D. Roosevelt successfully intervened to
protect banks and homeowners, addressing
Congress with a “declaration of national
policy” on April 13, 1933, which stated “that
the broad interests of the Nation require that
special safeguards should be thrown around
home ownership as a guarantee of social and
economic stability, and that to protect
homeowners from inequitable enforced
liquidation in a time of general distress is a
proper concern of the Government. “
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED that the members of the St. Louis
Board of Aldermen hereby call upon the United
States Congress to take emergency action to
protect homeowners and banks by enacting a

Homeowners and Banks Protection Act
specifically to:
1.

Establish a federal agency to place federal
and state chartered banks under
protection, freezing all existing home
mortgages for a period of time, adjusting
mortgage values to fair prices,
restructuring existing mortgages at
appropriate interest rates, and writing off
speculative debt obligations of mortgagebacked securities, financial derivatives,
and other forms of financial pyramid
schemes that have brought the banking
system to the point of bankruptcy; and

2.

Declare a moratorium on all home
foreclosures for the duration of the
transitional period, allowing families to
retain their homes. Monthly payments,
the equivalent of “rental payments”, shall
be made to designated banks, which can
use the funds as collateral for normal
lending practices, thus recapitalizing the
banking system. These affordable
monthly payments will be factored into
new mortgages, reflecting the orderly
deflating of the housing bubble, the
establishment of appropriate property
valuations, and reduced fixed mortgage
interest rates. While this may take several
years to achieve, in the interim period no
homeowner shall be evicted from his or
her property, and the federal and state
chartered banks shall be protected so that
they can resume their traditional
functions, serving local communities and
facilitating credit for investment in
productive entities; and

3.

Authorize governors of several states to
assume the administrative responsibilities
for implementing the program, including
the “rental” assessments to designated
banks, with the federal government
providing the necessary credits and
guarantees to assure the successful
transition; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the
Clerk of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen be
instructed to prepare a properly inscribed
copies of this Resolution for the President of
the United States and each member of the
Missouri Congressional delegation.
