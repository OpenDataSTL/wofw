Resolution No. 141
WHEREAS, in January, 1988, six
religious leaders from St. Louis traveled to El
Salvador to make a covenant with the people
of Guarjila, Chalatenango, one of the
communities who returned from the Mesa
Grande Refugee Camp (run by UNHCR).
Fifteen companion communities joined the St.

Louis Inter-Faith Committee on Latin America
in the effort to offer economic, moral, medical,
and social service assistance to the
community; and
WHEREAS, since the return on October
12, 1987, the citizens of Guarjila have, with
the help of sister communities and parishes in
St. Louis, Milwaukee and Seattle, and various
groups in Europe, built homes and composting
latrines for all of the 1900 residents (97% of
whom own their homes); developed a potable
water system to each home; established a
school for the children from pre-K through
9th grade, and collaborated with a neighboring
village for a secondary baccalaureate program;
sent students to university; maintained a
community radio station; and developed small
businesses (carpentry, bakery, dried fruit,
welding, restaurants, crafts store and many
grocery/notions stores). NGOs and the
Salvadoran government have paved roads and
brought electricity and phone service/internet
to the community.
WHEREAS, Sr. Ann Manganaro, sister
of Loretto, was a medical doctor who left her
work at Cardinal Glennon Hospital to live
and work in Guarjila from 1988 until 1993

Jon Cortina, a Jesuit priest from Spain (who
received his engineering degree from St. Louis
University), arranged for the buildings and
Ann served the people as their doctor and
dear friend during the last years of the civil
war. Today the clinic is the model site for the
free national community based healthcare
system for the country. The Salvadoran
medical staff, many of whom were trained by
Ann, serve Guarjila and the surrounding area
with skill and distinction.

Committee on Latin America continues to
accompany the people of Guarjila through
maintaining relationships, support of the
health promoters at the clinic, and immersion
experiences for students from Nerinx Hall
High School who raise funds for scholarships
for young women.
WHEREAS, there are growing stresses
placed on the community by free trade
agreements and other economic projects which
are contributing to an exodus of young people
to the US and the current immigration crisis.
The struggle continues for meaningful
employment and positive futures for the
youth. We recognize that the people of
Guarjila continue their valiant struggle to create
a community based on the values of selfdetermination, solidarity and justice, in spite
of many challenges from political and
economic forces.

NOW THEREFORE IT BE
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the leaders and
courageous people of Guarjila on the occasion
of their twenty-fifth anniversary, and

Guarjila with moral and material support, St.
