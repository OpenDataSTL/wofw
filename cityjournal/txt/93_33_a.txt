Resolution No. 229

Charles Reed Shaw
WHEREAS, Charles Reed Shaw was
born on January 27, 1923 in Augusta,
Arkansas. He was the last child born to the
union of William and Rosie Shaw. His parents,
as well as his sisters, Irma Ruth Newman,
Luddie Mae Moore, Milisa Shaw, and his
brothers, John Buffet Shaw, Andrew Jennings
Shaw (Uncle Pop) and Jake Shaw all preceded
him in death. He also leaves a loving sister,
Rosalie Riggins who currently resides in
Cambridge, Massachusetts; and

WHEREAS, his first business was a
lemonade stand as a young boy in his
neighborhood. As a born leader, he
accomplished many goals starting with an
honorable discharge from the United States
Army in 1945. In the Army, he was responsible
for getting ammunition to his fellow soldiers
on the enemy lines. He used to say “I had to
dodge bullets and bombs all around me.” He
was one of several black soldiers awarded a
special commendation from Jefferson City,
MO, the State Capital of Missouri, because
they were never properly recognized for their

bravery during World War II; and
WHEREAS, Charles Shaw quickly
worked his way up from a curtain hanger to a
laborer and finally to the Union President of
the Water Department for the City of St.
Louis. He was introduced to the union by the
then current union president, Mr. John
McGlothan whom he highly respected as his
mentor. He quickly became a dedicated worker
of the union and was nominated to the
President of the National Federation of Water
Department Local 675, which represented
about 9,000 city workers for over 25 years.
As a Union President, he joined forces with
the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal employees, increasing the political
power of the union with support of the AFSC.
He grew the Union from only water works
employees to more city employees including
ambulance drivers, employees of the city
hospitals, and various public agencies and
centers; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Shaw worked directly
over the reign of several St. Louis Mayors
including Alfonso J. Cervantes, James
Conway, Vincent Schoemehl, and John Poelker.
He was known for rallying support of the
Black Clergy to assist him in putting pressure
on the city officials to raise concern for much
needed pay raises and better benefits for the
public workers. His motto was, “More
money or no work.” He stayed true to his
motto and led several strikes and was
ultimately granted sufficient pay increases and
better benefits; and
WHEREAS, in 1982 and 1983, he was
named campaign chairman for the United
Black Community Fund (UBCF). UBCF was
a non-profit tax-exempt charitable
organization that provided funds to agencies
serving the disadvantaged children and the
aged. Before he was an elected officer, he was
with the organization since its inception.
Under his leadership, the UBCF exceeded its
financial campaign goals for the first time in
its nine-year history. Charles and his son
William Shaw were reported by the St. Louis
Post Dispatch as instrumentally the reason
to the overwhelming success of the campaign
drive. They exceeded their goal by $50,000
the first year and $100,000 the second year;
and
WHEREAS, one of his final
accomplishments was the building of the
Charles R. Shaw Union Hall for Local 675 as
a black-owned business in the community.
The building was created ti meet the business
and social needs within the community. The
hall was reserved for political events to family
reunions. Mr. Shaw finally retired from his
professional career in the mid 1990s and
continued his work in the senior community;

and
WHEREAS, some of his awards and
commendations include: Martin Luther King
Humanitarian Award, various leadership
awards from the City of St. Louis and
Jefferson City, many proclamations and
commendations, the Humanitarian Award from
the University of Missouri-St. Louis(his name
currently resides on the campus on a plaque
award), 2 Bronze Stars- United States Army,
Good Conduct Award- United States Army,
Special Military Commendation Award; and
WHEREAS, he leaves 10 children to
cherish his memory. His eldest son, Charles
H. Shaw preceded him in death. He leaves his
daughter-in-law Valerie Shaw (Charles Shaw),
Irene (Malcolm) Ross, Beverly ShawThomas, Stanley Shaw, William J. Shaw,
Sharron Y. Essex, Timothy D. Shaw, Andrew
D. (Debbie) Shaw, Charlotte Shaw, Carmen
Currie-Shaw and Kayla R. Shaw. He has 20
grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren (one
preceded him in death) and 6 great-great
grandchildren.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause to
remember the many contributions of Charles
Reed Shaw to the citizens of the City of St.
Louis and we join with his many friends in
expressing our sorrow at his passing, and we
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes
of these proceedings and to prepare a memorial
copy for presentation to the Shaw family, at a

William; stepfather, David Macklin;
grandmothers, Shirley Harrison and Juanita
Logan welcome Donta back from his most
recent tour in Iraq.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT

Introduced on the 22nd day of October, 2010

Honorable Lewis E. Reed, President, Board ofAldermen

Resolution No. 231

Northern Missionary Baptist Church
WHEREAS, Northern Missionary
Baptist Church (NMBC) started from a
neighborhood Sunday School. In 1909, Sister
Sarah Marlow, a member of Pleasant Green
Baptist Church began a Sunday School in her
home on Ewing Avenue for children who were
not in attendance at any church. She used old
Sunday School literature supplied by her
pastor, Rev. John K. Parker. Rev. Parker also
gave her books, pictures, cards, and small
testaments for the children. The Sunday
School became so interesting that the adults
started coming. When the crown grew too
large for her home, she asked permission to
use an old store on Bernard Street. After
Sunday School, she would have prayer
meeting. The people seemed so happy about
prayer service, she told Rev. Parker. He
replied, “Sarah, a church in that community is
necessary! You have my support”; and

WHEREAS, in November 1910,
Northern Missionary Baptist Church was
officially organized by Rev. A. Boggs. Rev.
Boggs was a missionary of the Antioch
District Association and given the name
“Northern Baptist”. Rev. Sam Terry was the
first pastor. After six months on Bernard
Street, the church moved to 600 South Ewing
at Scott Avenue in a store front. The members
would bring lamps filled with oil so they would
have light. Rev. Terry left in 1911; and

WHEREAS, the church elected Rev.
Nichols, who served eighteen months. In
1913, Rev. Shields was elected pastor. He

served from 1913-1916 and resigned. The
church kept struggling and elected Rev. Martin,
who served from 1916-1929. Under his
leadership the church moved to 514 S. Ewing
Avenue. The church remained there for forty
years. Rev. Martin failed in health and
resigned. The church elected Rev. Cooper.
He served from 1929-1933; and
WHEREAS, in 1933 Rev. William
Munger was elected. He was an able minister.
Under the leadership of Rev. Munger, the
mortgage was paid off on the building at 514
South Ewing Avenue. He spent many hours
of physical labor in the church building. Not
only working in the church, he worked with
people in the community. He gained love and
respect of all the people in the community.
The church continued to grow. Many souls
came into the church under his administration.
He served from 1933-1942. When his health
failed, he decided to go away for a rest. On
February 15, (a Sunday morning) he asked
Rev. Felix Shepard to serve in his place while
he was gone. He passed on February 22, 1942
while he was away. This brought sadness to
the congregation; and
WHEREAS, after a year of prayer and
supplication to our Lord, Rev. Harold J. Butler
was elected as pastor on March 7, 1993. Upon
the pulpit committee’s interview of Rev.
Butler on October 17, 1992, most impressive
was his ability to set goals for spiritual growth.
Christian education, soul winning, and
financial support of the church. He stressed
the importance of leadership, not just winning
and financial support of the church. He
stressed the importance of leadership, not just
as a change to “be in charge” but as one
accountable for maintaining Christ’s standard
in himself as well as his congregation. To lead
one must be willing to prepare. One must
have enough commitment to God to plan; Rev.
Butler has shown to be one who has accepted
his calling.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the many
contributions of Northern Missionary Baptist
Church and wish them many years of
continued service and we further direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our honoree at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.
