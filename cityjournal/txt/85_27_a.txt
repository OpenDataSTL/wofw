Introduced on the 27th day of September, 2002 by:
Honorable James Shrewsbury, Alderman 16th Ward

Resolution No. 173
WHEREAS ,
the
duties
of
Administrative Assistant to the President can
be taxing and, at times, require every ounce of
patience and stamina; and
WHEREAS, Brian Kolde came to the
Office of the President during a time of
transition and uncertainty and yet managed
to perform his duties with all the necessary
skill and competence; and
WHEREAS , a steady diet of caffeinerich Diet Coke coupled with lemon Jolly
Ranchers have not only kept Mr. Kolde on
his toes but have also held him in good spirits
through a multitude of pranks, practical jokes
and all around childish behavior exhibited by
the president’s staff-namely Matt Murphy;
and
WHEREAS , the daily trials and
tribulations of constituent service, the
seemingly endless meetings and the glut of
non-stop phone calls would have scared off
many employees after the first week;

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the St. Louis Board of
Alderman the we pause in our deliberations
to congratulate Brian Kolde and wish him luck
in his new position with the City’s
Neighborhood Stabilization Office and that
we, in all seriousness, recognize Brian as a
exemplary public servant whose knowledge
of city government, commitment to making
St. Louis a better place to live and affable
disposition will serve him, and all of St. Louis
City, well in the future.

FIRST READING
OF RESOLUTIONS
Mr. Clay introduced Resolution No. 169
and requested that it be assigned to the
Committee on Public Employees for hearing.

Resolution No. 169
WHEREAS, pursuant to Section Nine
of Article XVIII of the St. Louis City Charter,
only the Director of Personnel has the
administrative authority to establish eligible
lists for employment positions within the Civil
Service System; and
WHEREAS , paragraph (h) of Section
Seven of the Article XVIII states that the Civil
Service Commission has no administrative
powers or duties, except for those specifically
granted by the Charter; and
WHEREAS, within recent weeks the
two year eligible list for the positions of
Captain and Battalion Chief within the City
Fire Department expired; and
WHEREAS, eligible lists have an
expiration date in order to assure that the best
available candidates are considered for the job
openings; and
WHEREAS , since the expiration of the
Captain and Battalion Chief list, the Civil
Service Commission has been asked by the
Director of Personnel to consider resurrecting
the expired list and allowing promotions to
continue to be made from this two year old
list of candidates; and
WHEREAS, maintenance of the eligible
list is an administrative function and duty of
the Personnel Director and the Civil Service

Commission is without authority to intervene
in this matter; and

WHEREAS, the City Charter does not
empower the Director of Personnel to renew
an expired eligible list and any attempt to do
so is illegal and disrespectful to the employees
of this City;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we remind the
members of the Civil Service Commission of
the limitations placed upon them by the City
Charter and request that they refrain from
considering the renewal of the expired eligible
list for the positions of Captain and Battalion
Chief and we further strongly express the
belief that this eligible list should not be
renewed.

Honorable Irving Clay, Jr., Aldeman 26th Ward
Honorable Irene Smith, Alderwoman 1st Ward
Honorable Dionne Flowers, Alderwoman 2nd Ward
Honorable Peggy Ryan, Alderwoman 4th Ward
Honorable Daniel Kirner, Alderman 25 Ward

Mr. Reed introduced Resolution No. 170
and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 170

WHEREAS, on Tuesday, November
5,2002, voters in the City of St. Louis and
across the State of Missouri will be asked to
entrust their vote, and their future, to one of
two major candidates seeking to represent
Missouri in the United States Senate; and

WHEREAS, it has come to the attention
of this Board that one of the candidates, former
Representative Jim Talent, has an established
record that is in direct conflict with the best
interests of the residents of the City of St.
Louis, including numerous issues of significant
importance such as health care, economic
development, prescription drugs and labor;
and

WHEREAS , Mr. Talent supported a
plan that left seniors at the mercy of drug
companies and HMOs for much needed
prescription drugs. As reported in the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch, on 10/19/95 and by his
vote #357 on 6/28/00, requiring seniors to
acquire additional private insurance instead
of voting to provide direct benefits through
Medicare; and

WHEREAS, In 2000, Talent again
proposed a prescription drug plan that would
have been too expensive for most
Missourians, and would still have required
our seniors to receive their coverage through
an expensive high-risk pool run by a private
insurance company. (Talent for Governor –
Missouri Access Plan, 10/4/00); and

WHEREAS , Mr. Talent has clearly
shown a contempt for the senior citizens of
our community and the nation, by his
steadfast refusal to support legislation to
mandate an affordable prescription drug
insurance program, instead opting to support
the interests of the private insurance lobby;
and
WHEREAS , prescription drug plans
offered by private companies would be
prohibitively expensive, not always available
and would offer vastly different coverage and/
or cost from one geographic area to another
based upon the profit motive of the insurance
companies; and
WHEREAS, private insurance
companies could change the benefit structure
at any time, increasing costs to seniors to
enhance their profits; and
WHEREAS , the plan supported by Mr.
Talent would leave senior citizens at the mercy
of the drug companies and HMOs for
assistance in paying for prescription drugs.
His plan would require seniors to acquire
additional private insurance rather than receive
a direct benefit through Medicare;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we support the
senior citizens of our community, and their
right to enjoy affordable and accessible
prescription drug programs, free from the self
serving interests of the drug company lobby,
and further, that this Board stands squarely
with our citizens in opposing Mr. Talent and
his anti-consumer, anti-elderly, pro insurance
interests.

Introduced on the 27th day of September, 2002 by:
Honorable Lewis E. Reed, Alderman 6 th Ward

obtained Resolution No. 170 stood
