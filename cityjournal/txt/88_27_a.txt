Resolution No. 139
Whereas, in 2003, five national labor
unions joined forces in pushing for reform of
the AFL-CIO, which had failed to adequately
address dwindling union membership
nationwide; and
Whereas, the New Unity Partnership
was formed to coordinate effective organizing
campaigns and declared that workers should
reform the AFL-CIO or “build something
stronger;” and
Whereas, the Partnership resulted in
unprecedented and candid discussions about
the future of America’s labor movement; and
Whereas, this year, the Partnership
reorganized and created a new coalition called
Change to Win; and
Whereas, this coalition has been
founded on the principle that every worker in

America has the right to a union that is focused
and has the strategy and resources to unite its
workers and win elections; and
