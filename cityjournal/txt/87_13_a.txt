Mr. President Shrewsbury introduced
Resolution No. 90 and requested that it be
assigned to the Committee on
Intergovernmental Affairs.

Resolution No. 90
WHEREAS, the St. Louis Board of
Aldermen believes the City of St. Louis must
provide quality services to its residents; and
WHEREAS, The City has experienced
cuts in important services because of
Missouri’s budget deficits over the last few
years; and
WHEREAS, Missouri needs new
revenue to prevent these and other deep budget
cuts and to pay for education, affordable
housing, child care, health care, prescription
drugs, public safety, environmental programs,
local aid, human services, and other badly
needed state and local programs; and
WHEREAS, if significant revenue is not
forthcoming, the City of St. Louis will face
increased pressure to raise property taxes and/
or fees, and/or cut vital services; and
WHEREAS, Missouri is in this fiscal
crisis because the sluggish national economy
has resulted in substantial loss of revenues;
and
WHEREAS, Missouri lost 76,500 jobs
between the start of the recession in March
2001 and December 2003; and
WHEREAS, President Bush and the
U.S. Congress could have provided $85 billion
in aid to the states during this nationwide fiscal
crisis, which would have eliminated every
state’s deficit, but instead chose to pass a tax
bill that provides only $20 billion in aid to
states and gives away $330 billion in tax
breaks, primarily to the wealthiest Americans;
and
WHEREAS, President Bush and the
U.S. Congress’ 2003 tax law will cost Missouri
millions of dollars over the next decade; and

WHEREAS, the 2003 tax law will yield
an average four-year tax cut of $342 to the
bottom 60% percent of Missouri taxpayers,
while the richest 1% in our state will receive
an average four year tax break of $69,905. By
2006, 89% of Missouri residents will receive
less than $100 in tax cuts; and

WHEREAS, tax breaks for the wealthy
do not “trickle down” and help middle and
low-income people. For example, the
permanent repeal of the federal estate tax will
divert almost $1 trillion dollars from domestic
priorities over the next 20 years, yet would
benefit only multi-millionaires. History shows
that large tax giveaways for the rich and extreme
inequality of wealth are followed by weak
economic growth and job loss; and

WHEREAS, Missouri relies on federal
aid in the form of Medicaid reimbursements,
general economic assistance, increased
spending on transportation and housing
development, direct homeland security
funding, and a strong Social Security system;
and
WHEREAS, President Bush and the
U.S. Congress’ 2003 tax law undermines our
state and local efforts in these areas, as well as
provides little tax relief to the vast majority
of the residents of Missouri;

NOW THEREFOR BE IT RESOLVED
that the Board of Aldermen of the City of St.
Louis calls upon the members of the Missouri
Delegation to the United States Congress to
vote to repeal the 2003 tax breaks that benefit
only upper-income taxpayers, and redirect a
portion of the restored funds to the states so
they can stop painful budget cuts, and
furthermore we call upon the members of the
Missouri Delegation to the United States
Congress to vote against any future tax breaks
for wealthy Americans or large corporations,
which erode the funding available for critical
domestic priorities; and be it resolved that the
St. Louis Board of Aldermen is hereby
authorized and directed to transmit duly
certified copies of this resolution to President
George W. Bush, the members of the Missouri
Delegation to the United States Congress, and
Governor Holden.
