Kelly; and
WHEREAS, Frances was born and
raised in Prescott, Arkansas, the daughter of
Alice Muldrow Langford and Floyd Langford;

faithful member of Washington Metropolitan

missed by her children, Monica, Veronica,

WHEREAS, The departure of one of
our colleagues, Alderman Michael McMillan
(D-19th Ward), has come to the attention of

Alderman Michael McMillan has been duly
elected to a County Office-not to worry it is
the Office of License Collector in the Missouri

Collector; and
WHEREAS, since the departure of
Alderman Michael McMillan was made
official by his swearing in public on January

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
deliberations
to
recognize
the
accomplishments of our colleague, Michael
McMillan, as he assumes his new
responsibilities of License Collector. We
implore him to remember us as he moves to
“greener pastures” and collects all of those
checks from our constituents. We further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
