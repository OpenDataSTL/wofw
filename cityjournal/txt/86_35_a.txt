COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
Mr. Shrewsbury introduced Resolution
Nos. 208-211 and the Clerk was instructed to
read same.

Resolution No. 208
WHEREAS, on International Human
Rights Day, December 10, 2003, tens of
thousands of workers across the nation will
mobilize to restore worker’s freedom to form
a union. This is one of the basic freedoms
guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, ratified in 1948 by Eleanor
Roosevelt and foru-fifths of the members of
the United Nations; and
WHEREAS, although it has been a law
in the United States since 1935 that workers
have the right to form unions, federal laws
have eroded over the years and are poorly
enforced; and
WHEREAS, union membership
provides workers better wages and benefits,
protection from discrimination and unsafe
workplaces while benefitting whole
communities by strengthening tax bases,
promoting equal treatment and enhancing civic
participation; and
WHEREAS, even though our laws
guarantee American workers the right to
choose for themselves whether to have a union,
employers across the nation routinely violate
that right. Workers are harassed, intimidated,
coerced and even fired just for exercising, or
attempting to exercise, this fundamental
freedom; and
WHEREAS, when employers violate
the right of workers to form a union, everyone
suffers; wages fall, race and gender pay gaps
widen workplace discrimination increases and
job safety standards disappear;
WHEREAS, the worker’s fundamental
right to choose a union is a public issue that

requires pubic policy solutions, including
legislative change;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis, that we fully endorse
the campaign to educate union members, the
public and other elected officials and to
advocate for legislative change to protect the
rights of workers in this country.

and distinguished history of service to the
African American community and is proud to
count among its illustrious membership, Dr.
W.E.B. DuBois, Justice Thurgood Marshall
and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; and
WHEREAS, the Epsilon Lambda

Louis on December 3, 1919 and today boasts
a membership of more than 400 civic minded
business and professional men; and

years the members of the Epsilon Lambda

the International Table Tennis Federation; and
Whereas, table tennis became an

Whereas, table tennis can be played at
