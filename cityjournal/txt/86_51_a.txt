RESOLUTION NUMBER 274
RESOLUTION OF THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN
OF THE CITY OF
ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI
ORDERING AND SETTING 2004
CABLE TELEVISION RATES FOR
BASIC SERVICE, EQUIPMENT,
INSTALLATIONS AND UPGRADE
PURSUANT TO
FCC FORMS 1240, 1205 and 1235
DATED OCTOBER 15, 2003
Community Unit
Identification # MO-0545
WHEREAS

1.
Section 623 of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47
U.S.C. § 543, as amended by the Cable
Consumer Protection and Competition Act
of 1992 (“Cable Act”), allows local franchise
authorities to regulate certain cable television
rates in accordance with rules and procedures
established by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC); and

2. The Board of Aldermen of the City of
St. Louis, Missouri (“City”), is the Franchise
Authority under the City Charter; is
empowered by Ordinance to consider and
decide cable-related issues; adopted on June
11, 1993, Board Resolution #47 authorizing
its Petition for Certification and Local Rules
for Rate Regulation; and is duly certified by
the FCC to regulate certain rates including
those for the Basic Service Tier (BST),
monthly equipment rentals, the hourly service
charge (HSC), and installation fees based on
the HSC, included in the Form 1205
(“equipment rates”); and

3. The Communications Division holds
duties delegated by the Board of Aldermen as
its Franchise Agency with respect to cable
matters under Cable Regulatory Ordinance
65431, Section Thirty-Two, and the Agency
is required under local rules to submit a report
and recommendation on rate proposals to the
Board; and

4.
Charter
Communications
Entertainment I, LLC, doing business as
Charter Communications (“Charter”) and
franchised to operate a cable system in the
City of St. Louis in accordance with terms of
a transfer of ownership from AT&T
Broadband on June 30, 2001 and its franchise
renewal agreement with the City of St. Louis
effective May 23, 2002, has submitted to the
City FCC Form 1240, “Updating Maximum
Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable
Services,” and its associated FCC Form 1205,
“Determining Regulated Equipment and
Installation Costs” (“Equipment Form”) both
dated October 15, 2003 (the “Rate Filing”);

5. The Rate Filing from Charter
calculates a decrease in the maximum permitted
rates (“MPR”) Charter may charge City
subscribers for “Basic” cable service, and
increases in the MPRs for hourly service
charge (HSC), equipment rental, and activities
including various types of installations, reconnections and changes in service); and
6. At the same time as the Rate Filing,
Charter also submitted a third rate form, FCC
Form 1235, “Abbreviated Cost of Service
Filing For Cable Network Upgrades,” seeking
to recover from subscribers to the Basic Service
Tier (BST) costs associated with its current
cable system upgrade, totaling $3.49 monthly
per subscriber for the next ten years, in
addition to the amount calculated in the Form
1240 rate; and
11. FCC rules (47 C.F.R. §76.937(a))
place the burden on the cable operator to
prove that its rates for basic service and
equipment are reasonable under applicable
federal law and regulations; and
12. FCC rules require that the cable
operator follow the FCC’s rules and
instructions with regard to preparation of Form
1240, Form 1205 and Form 1235, presenting
adequate support and documentation to
justify the operator’s proposed MPR; and
13. To the extent Charter fails to carry
its burden of proof, the City may order Charter
to reduce its rates and provide refunds based
on the information submitted by Charter and
on the best available information from other
sources; and
14. The Franchise Agency, having
identified certain problems, omissions, and
discrepancies in the Filings and supporting
documentation as filed by Charter, sought legal
and technical assistance in reviewing and
analyzing the Rate Filing; and
15. FCC rules allow the Local Franchise
Authority to (a) seek additional information
and supporting documentation from the cable
operator; (b) evaluate the correctness and
reasonableness of those submissions; (c) use
the most reliable data available to determine
an MPR; and (d) in the context of the best
information available, reasonably set maximum
permitted rates different from those calculated
by the Operator; and
16. The Agency has actively sought
additional information from Charter regarding
the basis for its rate calculations and afforded
Charter ample opportunity to respond to its
written Requests for Information regarding the
Filings; and
27. Charter has been afforded prior
opportunity to comment and has provided

comment on the rates recommended by the
Agency for this Order and the proposed rate
order was available for public comment prior
to adoption;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED THAT , with regard to regulated
rates in the City of St. Louis, the Board of
Alderman orders rates as follows, for the
reasons discussed below, as also outlined in
the Staff and Consultant Reports:
BASIC SERVICE TIER RATE
Discussion

17. Because Charter’s Form 1240 Filing
corrected many of the problems identified in
the previous year’s filing, review of the Form
1240 Filing by the City’s technical consultant,
Front Range Consulting, Inc. (“FRC”),
revealed only one significant area of concern,
that of programming costs, as indicated in
FRC’s Final Report on the Rate for Basic
Service in the City of St. Louis by Charter
Communications, Inc., submitted on January
2, 2004 (“FRC 1240 Report”), at p. 4; and
18. FCC regulations allow a cable
operator to pass through to subscribers in its
BST rate the net programming costs the
operator pays to programmers for channels
appearing on the BST; and
19. Under a multi-year programming
contract with Hallmark, Charter received
“launch support” money from Hallmark for
the change from part-time carriage to full-time
carriage of the Hallmark Channel, which
effectively reduced the cost of that channel to
Charter (FRC 1240 Report at 5); and
20. FRC’s review of the terms of this
contract, which were not available last year,
allowed FRC to make more precise its
determination of the proper offset of these
launch support payments against
programming costs, consistent with FCC
regulations (FRC 1240 Report at 5-6); and
21. FRC also identified and corrected
minor problems with programming costs of
two other channels, Weatherscan Local and
TV Guide (FRC 1240 Report at 6-7); and
22. The problem with Weatherscan
Local depended upon factual issues regarding
the price actually paid by Charter under a
contract document that appears to have been
amended by hand in some but not other
versions (FRC 1240 Report at 7) and with
TV Guide, the ability of Charter to avail itself
of two programming discounts (FRC Report
at 6); and

23. An affidavit from Charter’s senior
programming official would provide a
reasonably reliable way to resolve the specific

factual issue involving Weatherscan Local and
TV Guide, which appears to have an effect of
approximately one cent on the BST rate; and
for various reasons, Charter chose not to
provide such an affidavit, with the result that
the best available information indicates that
the correct BST rate is the $10.48 rate listed
on page 3 of the FRC 1240 Report; and

25. Because it was necessary to
recalculate Charter’s BST rate, FRC correctly
used the most current inflation data as of the
date of recalculation (January 2, 2004),
pursuant to FCC rules; and

26. The conclusions of the FRC 1240
Report appear to be reasonable and to be based
on the best available information; and

28. The Board of Aldermen finds that
Charter has not met its burden of proof in
supporting and justifying its proposed
Maximum Permitted Rate of $10.54 for the
Basic Service Tier for the period January
29,.2004 through January 28, 2005, and that
adjustments to the Form 1240 Filing are
necessary, based on the City’s assessment of
the information provided and not provided
by Charter since October 15, 2003.

29. The Board of Aldermen finds that
the descriptions, methodologies and
calculations in the FRC 1240 Report are the
best available basis for setting the BST rate,
and finds FRC’s recalculation and
recommendations for Charter’s maximum
permitted rate to be reasonable and
appropriate.
Approved Rate

30. For the period beginning February
1, 2004, the Board of Aldermen hereby
approves the following maximum permitted
rate (exclusive of applicable franchise fees and
sales taxes, but inclusive of the Regulatory
Fee charged to Charter by the FCC, which is
listed separately on Charter’s subscriber bills
in the City) in accordance with the rates
calculated and recommended in the FRC 1240
Report as the maximum rate that can be
charged for the BST:
BASIC SERVICE TIER
MAXIMUM PERMITTED
RATE……………………….. $ 10.48

To the extent that any further change in
the BST rate may be permitted pursuant to
FCC regulations, Charter shall provide
separate notice and explanation of such change
pursuant to applicable law.
Future Rate Filings

38. Charter shall use the $ 10.48 M P R
set in this Order as its starting point in carrying
out the BST rate calculations in its next rate

filing, including $1.3144 external and $0.09
markup costs. Charter shall also use $10.48
as the actual rate charged for purposes of
Worksheet 8 in their next 1240 filing for the
period from October 2003 through March
2004 or until Charter separately itemizes the
BST rate from the Form 1235 Network
Upgrade Rate, whichever is later.
EQUIPMENT AND
INSTALLATION RATES
Discussion
27. The Agency and its advisors
disagreed with Charter’s capitalization of
certain installation labor on Form 1205
Schedule A, reviewed Charter’s re-statement
of certain capitalized labor costs for 2002 and
sought further information from Charter with
which to correctly apportion such labor costs
on Schedule B.
28. The Agency’s advisors have outlined
in the FRC Report reasons for a reduction in
the MPR for the Hourly Service Charge (HSC)
from Charter’s proposed $26.95 to the Agency
recommended $25.00.
29. The Agency and FRC requested
additional information and documentation
from Charter to further explain and support
Charter calculation of the amounts of time
needed to complete different specific types
of installations or changes on service listed in
Step B of Form 1205, and compared field
information obtained by City Inspectors to
verify the applicability of such time frames.
Based on the initial review of Charter’s
Installation charge support calculations and
data obtained independently from the field ,
FRC concluded that the average times listed
for individual installation activities appear to
be too lengthy and not adequately supported.
FRC’s review also concluded that
separately listed activities and costs for VCR
connection (not requiring a separate trip) or
amplifier installations to maintain signal
quality, were already covered in other types
of Charter installations or activities. FRC
believes that approval of Charter’s proposed
rates for these items wold to lead to double
recovery of costs.
Maximum Permitted Rates
xx. For the period from February 1, 2004
through January 31, 2005 the Board of
Aldermen hereby orders that the Hourly

NETWORK UPGRADE RATE
Discussion
Charter’s Form 1205 calculated a $3.49
monthly rate per subscriber to recover the
cost of its system upgrade in the City of St.
Louis over a 10 year period. After inquires
from the City and re-calculation of certain
entries, Charter filed a revised Form 1205
indicating a $3.17 monthly rate in addition to
the Basic Service Tier Rate.
Such rate calculations are derived in part
from rules and formulas established by the
Federal Communications Commission for
other types of cost-of-service filings. A
number of complex issues must be resolved in
properly applying the rules and cost
allocations in the case of a Form 1235 filing.
The Agency and its advisors have
reviewed the filing itself, the FCC’s rules, as
well as Charter’s projections as to potential
revenues on an upgraded system from
subscriber rates and other sources.
The following items cause the Agency
and its Advisors to recommend a figure lower
than the $3.17 amount filed by Charter to
avoid over-recovery of Charter’s costs during
the life of the upgraded facilities:

a) Charter included in its $3.17 BST
calculation upgrade costs associated with the
introduction / maintenance of new digital and
other two-way services. Properly, these
should be excluded from the BST calculation
(or directly assigned to the cost non-regulated
services);

b) Charter has claimed there are no
savings in maintenance and repair costs as a
result of new plant facilities, substantial
reduction in the amount of amplifiers and
aerial cable;

c) Charter’s filing significantly
overstated the projected annual electric power
costs in its filing

d) Charter’s filing significantly
understated the potential for additional nonsubscriber revenues, by projecting there would
be no increase whatsoever in advertising, home
shopping, leased access revenues, over the
10 year period from 2004 to 2014. The FRC
report notes both modest growth projections
cited in industry publications.

e) Charter’s filing did not address the
revenue impact from the provision of new
and enhanced services on an upgraded system.
f) The FRC calculation took into account
documented previous non-BST revenue
increases in 2003 and 2004 which are directly
attributable to additional capacity on the
system.
Maximum Permitted Rate

The Board adopts the recommendation
of FRC in its 2004 Report that $0.75 be
approved as the monthly MPR derived from
Form 1235, for the maximum 120 month
recovery period, beginning October 1, 2003.
IMPLEMENTATION OF RATES

31. The rates set herein are subject to
further reduction and refund (to the extent
permitted under applicable law and regulations
as the same may be amended from time to
time).

32. Charter shall not charge any rate
higher than the rates set herein, nor increase
that rate, nor impose on subscribers any other
charge for basic service and equipment not
specified herein, including but not limited to
bulk and commercial rates (to the extent such
limitation is permitted by applicable law),
unless such charge is first filed with and
approved by the City, in accordance with
applicable law and regulations, including but
not limited to the notice requirements imposed
by 47 C.F.R.76.1603, or as otherwise
expressly permitted under applicable law and
regulations.

33. Charter may charge rates less than
a MPR indicated above, as long as such rates
ar e applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory
way, pursuant to applicable federal, state, and
local laws and regulations.
Rates ordered herein shall be

include interest computed at applicable rates
published by the Internal Revenue Service for
tax refunds and additional tax payments,
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.942(e).
36. Within thirty days from the date of
this Order, Charter shall file with the Agency

Should
information come to the City’s attention that
these representations were inaccurate in any

accepted as correct any specific entry,
explanation or argument made by Charter not
specifically addressed herein.
40. The City reserves all of its rights
with respect to rate regulation, including, but
not limited to, any right it may have to reopen
this rate proceeding based on new information
or rulings by governing authority, if it appears

regulations, and any right the City may have
to “true up” overcharges or undercharges in
connection with future rate filings pursuant
to 47 C.F.R. ?§ 76.922(e)(3).
41. This Order shall be effective
immediately upon its approval by the Board
of Aldermen. The rates set herein will govern
Charter’s basic service rates until Charter
lawfully implements a further rate change
pursuant to applicable FCC regulations. This
Order constitutes the written decision required
by 47 C.F.R. § ?76.936(a) and shall be released
to the public and to Charter, and a public notice
shall be published stating that this Order has
been issued and is available for review,
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. ?§ 76.936(b).

Resolution, report that they have considered
the same and recommend adoption.

Resolution No. 276
WHEREAS , refund anticipation loans
(RALs) and associated fees cost consumers
well over a billion dollars in 2003; and
WHEREAS, increasing numbers of
families claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit
lose some portion of their credit to high cost
of refund anticipation loans every year; and
WHEREAS, refund anticipation loans
siphon large sums from the tax refunds of St.
Louis taxpayers, especially low and moderate
income households which can least afford to
lose these dollars; and
WHEREAS, the annual percentage rates
(APRs) on these loans typically range from
97% to more than 200%; and
WHEREAS, these products result in
families being charged hundreds of dollars to
have their income taxes prepared and receive
their refunds 8 to 10 days faster than they
otherwise would; and
WHEREAS, these are dollars lost to St.
Louis families and to the economy of our city;
and
WHEREAS, these products are
aggressively marketed to lower income
neighborhoods; and
WHEREAS, there is documented
evidence of major sellers of refund anticipation
loans repeatedly misleading taxpayers about
the existence of cheaper alternatives to such
loans and failing to inform taxpayers about
the option of electronic filing without a loan;
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we call upon the
Attorney General for the State of Missouri
and the to carefully scrutinize tax preparers

conduct in connection with refund anticipation
loans and to take appropriate action to ensure
that their conduct is consistent with state law
and with accepted fair and ethical business
practices and we further support every effort
to protect our citizens from losing their tax
refunds dollars to overpriced loans and from
misleading and false information regarding their
tax preparation options.

Board of Aldermen Committee report,
March 12, 2004.

To the President of the Board of
Aldermen:

The Committee on Public Safety to
whom was referred the following Resolution,
report that they have considered the same and
recommend adoption.

Resolution No. 273

WHEREAS , protection of the health and
safety of residents, workers, business owners
and visitors in the City of St. Louis, including
protection from terrorist attack, is a
paramount concern for the City of St. Louis;
WHEREAS , the protection and exercise
of civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by
the U.S. Constitution, as amended, forms the
basis of our free and democratic society; and
WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis greatly
benefits from the many contributions of its
diverse population, including working people,
students, immigrants and refugees; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis believes that there is no
inherent conflict between national security and
the preservation of liberty -- United States
residents can be both safe and free; and
WHEREAS , the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis reaffirms its strong
opposition to terrorism, but also affirms that
any efforts to end terrorism not be waged at
the expense of the essential civil rights and
liberties of the innocent people of the City of
St. Louis, State of Missouri and United States;
and
WHEREAS , Government security
measures that undermine fundamental rights
do damage to the institutions and values that
the residents of the City of St. Louis hold
dear and which form the fabric of the oldest
and greatest continuous democracy in world
history;
WHEREAS, it is imperative that federal,
state and local governments should protect
the public from terrorist attacks, such as those
that occurred on September 11, 2001,
nevertheless, they should do so in a balanced,
rational, and deliberative fashion in order to
ensure that security measures enhance the
public safety without severely impairing
constitutional rights or infringing on civil
liberties by suffocating what makes us a free
democracy; and
WHEREAS, certain federal policies
adopted since September 11, 2001, including
the application of certain provisions of the
U.S.A. Patriot Act (P.L. 107-56; H.R. 31620
and related federal actions, including Orders
in furtherance thereof, may unduly infringe
upon fundamental rights and liberties and may
threaten civil rights and liberties guaranteed
as inalienable rights under the U.S.
Constitution, as amended; and
WHEREAS , these certain federal
policies include the power to authorize the
indefinite incarceration of non-citizens based
on mere suspicion of terrorist activity, and

the indefinite incarceration of citizens
designated as “enemy combatants” without
access to counsel or meaningful recourse to
the federal courts; limitations on the traditional
authority of federal courts to curb law
enforcement abuse of electronic surveillance
in anti-terrorism investigations and ordinary
criminal investigations; the expansion of the
authority of federal agents to conduct so-called
“sneak and peek” or “black bag” searches, in
which the subject of the search warrant is
unaware that his property has been searched;
grants to law enforcement and intelligence
agencies of broad access to personal, medical,
financial, library and education records with
little, if any, judicial oversight; and
WHEREAS , these same federal policies
may undermine trust between immigrant
communities and the government and, in
particular, pose a threat to the civil rights and
liberties of the residents of our City who are,
or who appear, to be of Arab, Muslim, or
South Asian descent; and
WHEREAS , the federal government has
drafted new legislation entitled the Domestic
Security Enhancement Act (known as Patriot
II), which may further compromise
constitutional rights and our government’s
unique system of checks and balances; and
WHEREAS , three states and more than
200 communities, including the City of New
York, have enacted resolutions that reaffirm
support for civil rights and civil liberties and
that demand accountability from law
enforcement agencies regarding the exercise of
the extraordinary new powers conferred by
the U.S.A. Patriot Act and related federal
actions.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED, that it is the policy of the City
of St. Louis that employees of the City of St.
Louis and its departments shall refrain from:
1. profiling based on race, ethnicity,
citizenship, religion, national origin, or nonviolent political values; and
2. denying any city service on the basis
of citizenship; and be it
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the City
of St. Louis will avoid discrimination in every
function of City government, and vigorously
uphold the constitutionally protected rights
of all persons; and be it
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis calls
upon federal, state, county and local officials
and upon City of St. Louis agencies and
institutions to affirm and protect civil rights
and civil liberties; and be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis affirms
its strong support for the rights of immigrants
and refugees and opposes measures that single
out individuals for legal scrutiny or
enforcement activity based primarily upon
their country of origin; and be it

FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis
encourages the St. Louis Board of Police
Commissioners and the St. Louis Metropolitan
Police Department to adopt and to follow
policies that prohibit its employees from:

1. investigating individuals or groups of
individuals based on their participation in
activities protected by the First Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, such as non-violent
political advocacy or the practice of religion,
without reasonable suspicion of criminal
activity unrelated to the activity protected
by the First Amendment;

2. profiling based on race, religion, or
ethnicity;

3. participating in the enforcement of
federal immigration laws, except to prevent
persons from a continuing practice of
transporting and harboring illegal aliens;

4. “sneak and peak” searches, pursuant
to Section 213 of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, unless
the search is authorized in accordance with
the laws of the State of Missouri and unless
searches are executed upon any resident of
the City of St. Louis by search warrant with
advance or simultaneous notice, and refrain
from participating in a joint search with any
law enforcement agency absent assurances
that such notice will be provided to such
individuals during the search; and

5. establishing or maintaining an antiterrorism reporting system that creates an
electronic record on an individual unless
subject to regulations that provide for the
protection of individuals who are the subject
of unfounded reports; and

6. without having, or being provided,
evidence showing a reasonable suspicion of
criminal activity:

a. assisting with investigations,
interrogations, or arrest procedures, whether

book and video store sales and/or rentals, and

or State of Missouri to exercise powers or
cooperate in the exercise of powers in
apparent violation of any city ordinance or
the laws or Constitution of this State or of the
United States; and be it
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis opposes
the secret detention of persons and the
detention of persons without charges or access
to a lawyer; and be it
FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis urges
each of the City’s public libraries to inform
library patrons that Section 215 of the U.S.
Patriot Act gives the government new
authority to monitor book-borrowing and
Internet activities without patrons’ knowledge
or consent and that this law prohibits library
staff from informing patrons if federal agents
have requested patrons’ library records; and
be it
FURTHER RESOLVED, that in order
to assess the effect of anti-terrorism initiatives
on the residents of the City of St. Louis, the
Board of Aldermen calls upon federal officials
to make periodic reports, consistent with the

actions carried out in the city of St. Louis
under powers granted in the U.S.A. Patriot

of St. Louis call on our United States
Representatives and Senators to monitor the
implementation of the U.S.A. Patriot Act and
the federal actions, including Orders in
