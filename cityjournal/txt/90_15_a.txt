To the President of the Board of
Aldermen:

The Committee on Public Safety to
whom was referred the following resolution,
report that they have considered the same and
recommend adoption.

Resolution No. 83
RESOLUTION OF THE
BOARD OF ALDERMEN
OF THE
CITY OF ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI
ORDERING AND SETTING 2007
CABLE TELEVISION RATES FOR
BASIC SERVICE, EQUIPMENT
and INSTALLATIONS
PURSUANT TO FCC FORMS 1240 and
1205 DATED OCTOBER 13, 2006

Community Unit Identification
# MO-0545
WHEREAS
1. Section 623 of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47
U.S.C. § 543, as amended by the Cable
Consumer Protection and Competition Act
of 1992 (“Cable Act”), allows local franchise
authorities to regulate certain cable television
rates in accordance with rules and procedures
established by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC); and
2. The Board of Aldermen of the City
of St. Louis, Missouri (“City”), is the
Franchise Authority under the City Charter;
is empowered by Ordinance to consider and
decide cable-related issues; adopted on June
11, 1993, Board Resolution #47 authorizing
its Petition for Certification and Local Rules
for Rate Regulation; and is duly certified by
the FCC to regulate certain rates including
those for the Basic Service Tier (BST),
monthly equipment rentals, the hourly service
charge (HSC), and installation fees based on
the HSC, included in the Form 1205
(“equipment rates”); and
3. The Communications Division
holds duties delegated by the Board of
Aldermen as its Franchise Agency with respect
to cable matters under Cable Regulatory
Ordinance 65431, Section Thirty-Two, and
the Agency is required under local rules to
submit a report and recommendation on rate
proposals to the Board; and
4. Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC, doing business as Charter
Communications (“Charter”) and franchised
to operate a cable system in the City of St.
Louis in accordance with terms of a transfer
of ownership from AT&T Broadband on June
30, 2001 and its franchise renewal agreement
with the City of St. Louis effective May 23,
2002, has submitted to the City its Original
FCC Form 1240, “Updating Maximum
Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable
Services,” and its associated FCC Form 1205,
“Determining Regulated Equipment and
Installation Costs” (“Equipment Form”) both
dated October 13, 2006 (the “Rate Filing”);
5. The Rate Filing from Charter
proposes a maximum permitted rates
(“MPR”) of $11.68 Charter may charge City
subscribers for “Basic” cable service, and
calculates increases in the MPRs for hourly
service charge (HSC), equipment rental, and
activities including various types of
installations, re-connections and changes in
service); and
6. FCC rules (47 C.F.R. §76.937(a))
place the burden on the cable operator to

prove that its rates for basic service and
equipment are reasonable under applicable
federal law and regulations; and

7. FCC rules require that the cable
operator follow the FCC’s rules and
instructions with regard to preparation of Form
1240 and Form 1205, presenting adequate
support and documentation to justify the
operator’s proposed Maximum Permitted
Rates; and

8. To the extent Charter fails to carry
its burden of proof, the City may order Charter
to reduce its rates and provide refunds based
on the information submitted by Charter and
/or the best available information from other
sources, and/or FCC rules, including a
previous FCC rate decision known as the
“Bresnan Ruling” which has particular
applicability to this case; and

9.
FCC rules allow the Local
Franchise Authority to (a) seek additional
information and supporting documentation
from the cable operator; (b) evaluate the
correctness and reasonableness of those
submissions; (c) use the most reliable data
available to determine an MPR; and (d) in the
context of the best information available,
reasonably set maximum permitted rates
different from those calculated by the
Operator; and

10. The Franchise Agency, having
identified certain problems, omissions, and
discrepancies in the Charter’s Original Form
1240 and supporting documentation as filed
by Charter, sought legal and technical
assistance in reviewing and analyzing the Rate
Filing; and

11. The City’s consultants, Miller &
Van Eaton, PLLC (“MVE”) and their financial
consultant, Front Range Consulting, Inc.
(“FRC”), prepared a City-Corrected Form
1240 which determined that Charter ’s
proposed MPR for the Basic Service tier did
not comply with FCC rules, did not use correct
data, was calculated incorrectly, and therefore
should be $11.13, not $11.68; and

12. The City’s Local Rules provide
Charter ample opportunity to review and
comment on the City consultant’s recalculations and accompanying Rate Report
which discussed the applicable rules,
corrections and analysis justifying the lower
rate; and

13. Charter commented on the Rate
Report and City Corrected Form 1240 ,
submitted its own May 23, 2007 Revised
Form 1240 indicating Charter’s that the MPR
should be $11.33, not $11.68, and requested
that any further recalculation by the City
should take into account the actual inflation

factors published to date by the FCC for
2005-2007, and
14. The City has complied with that
request in its recalculation; by correctly using
the accurate past and current inflation data
pursuant to FCC rules, as shown in the 2nd
City Corrected Form 1240 and explained in
the consultant’s accompanying Addendum to
Rate Report and the 2007 Staff Report; and,

15. In accordance with FCC rules,
Charter is allowed to add a previously
calculated monthly System Upgrade Surcharge
to the Basic Service Tier rate, not to exceed
$0.75 for the 120 month period commencing
October 2003. and

16. Charter’s Operator Selected Rates
for Equipment and Installations as submitted
are based on national averaged cost data and
are equal to or less than the Maximum
Permitted Rates as calculated by Charter on
Form 1205; and

17. The Agency has supported its 2007
Staff Report recommendations to this Board
with the reports and exhibits prepared by
Front Range Consulting as received and
reviewed by the Board’s Public Utilities
Committee.

NOW
THEREFORE
BE
IT
RESOLVED THAT, with regard to regulated
rates in the City of St. Louis, for the reasons
outlined herein ,and as also discussed in the
2007 Staff Report and the FRC Rate Report
and Addendum, incorporated herein by
reference, the Board of Aldermen finds and
resolves as follows:
MAXIMUM PERMITTED RATES

18. Charter has not met its burden of
proof in supporting and justifying either its
initial proposed Maximum Permitted Rate of
$11.68 for the Basic Service Tier or its revised
proposed rate of $11.33 for the period
February 1, 2007 through January 31, 2008.
Charter’s proposed maximum charge of
$12.43 and Operator-selected current charge
of $12.42 per month (including the $0.75
System Upgrade Surcharge) is unreasonable.
Adjustments to the Form 1240 Filings were
necessary, based on the City’s assessment of
accurate information.

19. The descriptions, methodologies
and calculations in FRC’s 1240 Rate Report
and Addendum are the preferable available
basis for setting the BST rate in accordance
with FCC rules, and FRC’s recalculations of
Charter’s maximum permitted rates are
reasonable and appropriate.

20. For the twelve month period
beginning February 1, 2007, the BASIC
SERVICE TIER MAXIMUM PERMITTED

RATE shall be $11.13. Combined with the
System Upgrade Surcharge of $0.75 per
month, the total combined Basic Rate charged
to subscribers may not exceed $11.88,
inclusive of the regulatory fee Charter pays
to the FCC (which Charter lists separately on
subscriber bills) but exclusive of applicable
franchise fees and sales taxes.
21. Charter shall use the $ 11.13 MPR
set in this Order as its starting point in carrying
out any future required BST rate calculations.
22. The rates set herein are subject to
further reduction and refund to the extent
permitted under applicable law and regulations
as the same may be amended from time to
time.
23. To the extent that any further change
in the BST rate may be permitted pursuant to
FCC regulations, Charter shall provide
separate notice and explanation of such change
pursuant to applicable law.
IMPLEMENTATION OF RATES
24. Charter shall not charge any rate
higher than the rates set herein, nor increase
that rate, nor impose on subscribers any other
charge for basic service not specified herein,
including but not limited to bulk and
commercial rates (to the extent such limitation
is permitted by applicable law), unless such
charge is first filed with and approved by the
City, in accordance with applicable law and
regulations, including but not limited to the
notice requirements imposed by 47
C.F.R.76.1603, or as otherwise expressly
permitted under applicable law and
regulations.
25. Charter may charge rates less than
the MPR indicated above, as long as such rates
are applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory
way, pursuant to applicable federal, state, and
local laws and regulations.
26. Charter shall implement the $11.88
Basic Service Tier Rate on subscriber bills no
later than 40 days after the date of this
Resolution, and shall continue to list or explain
the BST charge as previously required.
27. Charter shall issue to each
subscriber a refund in an amount equal to the
$0.54 monthly overcharge for the period
between February 1, 2007 and actual
implementation of the $11.13 rate on that
subscriber’s bill. This amount shall be placed
as a one-time credit on each subscriber’s
account no later than 40 calendar days after
the date of this Resolution.
28. Charter shall file with the Franchise
Agency a report submitted no later than 72
calendar days after the date of this order. The
report shall be attested to and signed by an

officer of the company. The Agency is hereby
authorized to require additional information
as necessary to determine compliance with
this Order.

29. Within 72 days from the date of
this Order, Charter shall file with the Agency
a certification, signed by an authorized
representative of Charter, including: (a)
whether and how Charter has complied fully
with the provisions of this order; (b) measures
taken to implement the specified rate; (c) an
accounting of ordered refunds: the amount
refunded to each subscriber, the date of the
refunds, the number of subscribers who
received the credit and the total amount of
refunds issued.
OTHER

30. The findings herein are based on the
representations of Charter.
Should
information come to the City’s attention that
these representations were inaccurate in any
material way, the City reserves the right to
take appropriate action. This Order is not to
be construed as a finding that the City has
accepted as correct any specific entry,
explanation or argument made by Charter not
specifically addressed herein.

31. The City reserves all of its rights
with respect to rate regulation, including, but
not limited to, any right it may have to reopen
this rate proceeding based on new information
or rulings by governing authority, if it appears
that such new information or rulings could
alter the reasonable rates prescribed by FCC
regulations, and any right the City may have
to “true up” overcharges or undercharges in
connection with future rate filings pursuant
to 47 C.F.R. § 76.922(e)(3).

32. This Order shall be effective
immediately upon its approval by the Board
of Aldermen. The rates set herein will govern
Charter’s basic service rates until Charter
lawfully implements a further rate change
pursuant to applicable FCC regulations. This
Order constitutes the written decision required
by 47 C.F.R. § 76.936(a) and shall be released
to the public and to Charter, and a public notice
shall be published stating that this Order has
been issued and is available for review,
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. § 76.936(b).
