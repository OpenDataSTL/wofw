Unanimous consent having been

FIRST READING OF
RESOLUTIONS

Mr. Conway introduced Resolution No.
242 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 242

WHEREAS, in 2010 the City of St.
Louis closed the Gasconade shelter to the
public. Gasconade was obsolete and inhumane.
It was built during World War II as a catchand-kill facility. Dogs were held for one day,
and euthanized. No thought was given to the
comfort of animals. Disease and infection
control was almost impossible. Too many of
the healthy loose dogs in Gasconade were
euthanized; and

WHEREAS, since 2010, the City animal
control division partnered with Stray Rescue
to implement a catch-and-adopt policy. The
City’s partnership with Stray Rescue has
resulted in fewer loose dogs on our streets,
fewer complaints about loose dogs, more
adoptions and fewer euthanizations at less
cost to the taxpayers; and

WHEREAS, because the City is
admitting fewer animals to its animal control
facility, its employees are more focused on

enforcing the law. So, it is issuing more
citations. The result is a dramatic reduction in
euthanized dogs and an increase in adoptions.
The Citizens Service Bureau (CSB) is getting
fewer calls for loose animals. The public is
safer and animals are being treated better; and
WHEREAS, as far as the City has come
in one year, it can do better. Building a new,
state-of-the-art City-run animal control
facility would cost more than $4-million.
Staffing it would cost $1-million per year; and
WHEREAS, when the City formed its
partnership with Stray Rescue in 2010, it
knew it would have to make adjustments and
improvements. It is. The City’s goals in Phase
II of its original plan are the following:
• Use the Animal Protection Facility
Restoration Fund for the purpose of
paying the costs related to the
construction and maintenance of a new
animal protection facility;
• Increase the number of City animal
control specialists on the streets to
remove loose and dangerous animals
while enforcing ordinances;
• Increase kennel capacity by adding a City
owned and managed facility;
• Improve communications between animal
control, CSB and Police Department to
speed up response to loose animal calls;
• Expand adoption in place to help lowincome families keep pets they could not
otherwise afford;
• Allow for pet owners to call CSB to
surrender pets;
• Create and manage a Lost Dog Registry;
• Produce written agreements between the
City and Stray Rescue to define roles
and responsibilities; and
• Provide Stray Rescue with security staff;
and
WHEREAS, Ordinance 65435,
approved February 15, 2002, established, in
part the “Animal Protection Facility
Restoration Fund” for the purpose of paying
the costs related to the construction and
maintenance of a new animal protection
facility; and
WHEREAS, Section Four of such
Ordinance provides that Funds maintained in
“Animal Protection Facility Restoration”
account shall be used only to pay for all costs
related to the construction of a new Animal
Protection Facility and for materials and
equipment required to properly maintain such
facility; and

WHEREAS, Section Five of such
Ordinance provides that the Director of
Health and Hospitals shall recommend the use
of said funds to the Health and Human Services
Committee of the Board of Aldermen which
shall determine the capital improvements for
which the funds should be used, which use
shall be consistent with this ordinance, and
the Director, upon resolution passed by said
Committee shall have the authority to prepare
the necessary vouchers for such use of funds
and the Comptroller, upon receipt of such
voucher, shall draw warrants on the Fund. No
part of such funds shall be used for any general
operating purpose or expense, salaries, or
advertising; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Ordinance
65435, the Director has forwarded her
recommendations to the Chairman of the
Health and Human Services Committee; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED that pursuant to Ordinance
65435 the Health and Human Services
Committee does hereby approve the
recommendations of the Director for the
appropriation of the Animal Protection
Facility Restoration Fund Account funds
attached hereto and Exhibit A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that
copies of this resolution are to be maintained
by the Clerk of the Board of Aldermen; printed
in the Journal of the Board of Aldermen and
delivered to the Director of Parks, Recreation
and Forestry, the Budget Division and the
Comptroller.
