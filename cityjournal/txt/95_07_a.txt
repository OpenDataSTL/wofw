Resolution No. 9

Genocide Awareness
and Prevention Month
WHEREAS, during the Second World
War, Raphael Lemkin, a Polish lawyer of
Jewish descent, motivated by the attempted
extermination of the Armenian and Assyrian
communities during the First World War,
coined the term “genocide” to describe a
coordinated plan of actions aimed at the
destruction of essential foundations of the life
of national groups, with the aim of annihilating
a group itself, for example, by disintegrating a
group’s political and social institutions,
culture, language, national feelings, religion,
and economic existence, and destroying the
personal security, liberty, health, and dignity,
and the lives of individuals belonging to the
group; and

WHEREAS, following the Holocaust,
on December 9, 1948, the United Nations
General Assembly adopted Resolution 260
(III) A, the United Nations Convention on
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
of Genocide, declaring genocide to be a crime
under international law, and defining genocide
to include the commission of certain acts,
including killing members of the group, causing
serious bodily or mental harm to members of
the group, deliberately inflicting conditions
of life calculated to bring about a group’s
physical destruction in whole or in part,
imposing measures intended to prevent births
within the group, and forcibly transferring
children of the group to another group, with
the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a
national, ethnic, racial, or religious group; and
WHEREAS, in 2008, the Prevention of
Genocide Task Force, convened by the United
States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the
American Academy of Diplomacy, and the
United States Institute of Peace, issued a
report finding that in order to prevent future
genocides and mass atrocities, effective
prevention measures must be implemented
before a crisis has erupted, and that educating
the public can help to protect individual rights

and promote a culture of lawfulness that will
help prevent future genocides; and
WHEREAS, educating the public about
the evils of genocide and commemorating
victims of genocide, including the recognition
of a Genocide Awareness and Prevention
Month, are effective tools that will further
these goals.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the Month of April
as Genocide Awareness and Prevention
Month and we direct the Clerk of this Board
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the

Resolution No. 15
Pastor Shirley Caesar
WHEREAS, raised in North Carolina,
Pastor Shirley Caesar grew in an environment
of obstacles; segregation, the death of her

father at eight years old and caring for a semiinvalid mother. This made for a less than ideal
upbringing for this budding star, but she
accepted the challenges with her head held
high. She has stayed close to her roots, but
her personal and professional credits prove
her unfaltering devotion; and

WHEREAS, Pastor Shirley Caesar
began singing as a young girl in church.
Meanwhile struggling with school, she was
encouraged to pursue goals outside of
academics. In characteristic strength, she
continued with education while developing
into a remarkable musical talent; and

WHEREAS, she eventually graduated
Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Arts
Degree in Marketing from Shaw University,
and has been granted several honorary degrees
from other educational institutions; and

WHEREAS, she began her professional
singing career with the Caravans in the mid
60s, performing and recording with the group.
In 1966, her solo career began to take flight as
audiences learned of and yearned for her soul
stirring voice; and

WHEREAS, Pastor Shirley Caesar has
recorded over forty albums since the 60s
exploring her gift and spreading messages of
faith. She has participated in over 16
compilations and three gospel musicals,
Mama I Want to Sing, Sing: Mama 2, and Born
to Sing: Mama 3; and

WHEREAS, her credits also include a
series of commercials for MCI
Communications and several awards for her
recordings. She has been awarded 11 Grammy
Awards, 13 Stellar Awards, 18 Doves, 3 RIAA
gold certifications, an Essence Award,
McDonald’s Golden Circle Lifetime
Achievement Award, NAACP Achievement
Award, SESAC Lifetime Achievement Award,
as well as induction into the Gospel Music
Hall of Fame. Pastor Shirley has made several
notable appearances including the televised
Live from Disney World Night of Joy, the
Gospel According to VH-1, a White House
performance for President George Bush, and
a speech on the Evolution of Gospel Music
to the US Treasury Department; and

WHEREAS, while Pastor Caesar has
enjoyed a fulfilling career, her personal
achievements are just as commendable. She is
married to Bishop Harold Williams, husband
of twenty years. She is Pastor of a growing
congregation, Mount Calvary Word of Faith
Holy Church in Raleigh, North Carolina. This
ministry has grown from seventeen to over
500 members; and

WHEREAS, she sites her mother as a

strong influence in her decision to give so
selflessly of herself. The pastor has committed
a sizeable portion of all concert sales to her
Outreach Ministries, continues to deliver
weekly sermons and leads an annual Outreach
Ministries conference; and
WHEREAS, living a life devoted to
greatness, Pastor Caesar is doing her part to
make it all a little better. With a schedule
including recording, performing, and
ministering, Pastor Shirley constantly finds
ways to spread messages of love and
encouragement. She is a warm soul with
remarkable intentions and talent evidenced by
her selfless acts and expansive artistic
prowess.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize and honor Pastor
Shirley Caesar and direct the Clerk of this
Board to spread a copy of the resolution over
the permanent rolls of this Board and to
prepare a fitting copy of this resolution to be
presented to the honorees at a time and place
deemed appropriate by its sponsor.
