COURTESY RESOLUTIONS
CONSENT CALENDAR
President Reed introduced Resolutions
No. 74 and 76 through 81 and the Clerk was
instructed to read same.

Resolution No. 74
83rd Anniversary of Scruggs
Memorial Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church
WHEREAS, we have been apprised that
Scruggs Memorial Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church will be celebrating its 83rd
Anniversary; and
WHEREAS, the Scruggs Memorial
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church was
purchased and organized in July 1925 under
the leadership of Bishop Randall A. Carter,
D.D., A.M., LL. D., Presiding Bishop, assisted
by the late Bishop N.C. Cleaves, Dr. Holman
Wadsworth Evans, who was then Pastor of
Lane Tabernacle and Mrs. Laura Sneed Fox.
After the transaction was completed, the name
Scruggs Memorial was retained by the
congregation because of its historical
significance; and
WHEREAS, the church is designed in
the “Gothic Revival” style that was prevalent
during the latter part of the 19th century and
is constructed of Indiana limestone and
concrete with Belford stone trimming all
around the front and side of the building. It is
believed that the church is one of the few
remaining Missouri churches (built in the late
1800’s) in that architectural style. The church
was designed by a local St. Louis architect,
Thomas B. Annan, and created in 1884.
Members of the congregation added a brick
annex to the church in 1964; and
WHEREAS, the purchase price for the
church in 1925 was $45,000.00. The church
is grateful to Lane Tabernacle for underwriting
the first $10,000.00 paid on this great building.
Rev. R.O. Langford, Secretary of Evangelism
served as the first pastor until the Annual
Conference meeting in October. In the first
few years this newly organized congregation
made some progress but found it rather
difficult to meet the indebtedness of the
church. In 1934, while the General Conference
was in session at Scruggs, Rev. T.J. Moppins,
pastor and a delegate to the General Conference
succeeded in introducing a Resolution to this
body to underwrite the indebtedness of
Scruggs. In 1944 under the pastorate of Rev.
J. Clarence Colclough, the entire debt was
liquidated followed by a mortgage burning
service led by Bishop Randall A. Carter; and

WHEREAS, the spiritual growth and
development of this church is one of
everlasting credit to the founding fathers and
the succession of consecrated ministers that
have led this great congregation to its place of
leadership in this community. The growth of
the church has been constant with all the
Pastors contributing to its success. Scruggs is
one of the landmarks of the C.M.E. Church
and stands as a monument to the many
sacrifices made, not only by the local
membership, but by the General Church. One
of the Charter Members of Scruggs, Mrs.
Jeanette Stith, is still living; and

WHEREAS, the following is the
Pastor’s Roster at Scruggs from 1925 to the
present: Rev. R.O. Langford, Rev. W. T.
Moore, Rev. I.C. Nicholson, Rev. H. W. Evans,
Rev. H. L. Bolden, Rev. A. W. Womack, Rev.
T. L. Moppins, Rev. F. L. Lewis, Rev. J. Reed,
Rev. J. C. Harris, Rev. E. W. Walker, Rev. W.
L. Liddell, Rev. J. C. Colclough, Rev. J. R.
McClain, Rev. D. S. Cunningham, Rev. F. M.
Dickey, Rev. J. H. Douglass, Rev. L. L.
Reddick III, Rev. J. C. Clay, Rev. W. H.
Crenshaw, Rev. G. H. Williams, Rev. D. L.
Fitten, Rev. I. A. Hentrel, Rev. J. D. Johnson,
Rev. M. L. Lue, Rev. J. T. Stewart and Rev. G.
H. Williams; and

WHEREAS, Scruggs has provided a
variety of ministries to the Midtown area of
St. Louis City. They have operated a Child
Abuse Prevention Program, had a strong viable
youth and young adult ministry extending its
outreach activities into the community, been
a site for the Summer Lunch Program, provided
after-school tutoring during the school year,
and had a weekly Arts and Crafts Program for
Senior Adults.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize Scruggs Memorial
Christian Methodist Episcopal Church on
their 83rd Anniversary and thank them for
their innumerable contributions to the City of
St. Louis in the community and we further
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy
of this Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
our honoree at a time and place deemed
appropriate by the Sponsor.

Resolution No. 76

Centennial Celebration will be held in the
Joseph Schulte Theatre at St. Louis University
High School; and

Dances of India, Detroit Legacy Project,
Innervision Dance Theatre, Lincoln University
Dance Troupe, SIU East St. Louis Performing

WHEREAS, Katherine Dunham was
perhaps best known for bringing African and
Caribbean influences to the Europeandominated dance world. In the late 1930’s,
she established the nation’s first selfsupporting all-black modern dance group; and

WHEREAS, during her career, Dunham
choreographed ‘Aida’ for the Metropolitan
Opera and musicals such as ‘Cabin in the Sky’
for Broadway. She also appeared in several
films, including ‘Stormy Weather’ and
‘Carnival of Rhythm.’ Her dance company
toured internationally from the 1940s to the
’60s, visiting 57 nations on six continents.
Her success was won in the face of widespread
discrimination, a struggle Dunham championed
by refusing to perform at segregated theaters;
and
WHEREAS, for her endeavors, Dunham
received 10 honorary doctorates, the
Presidential Medal of the Arts, the Albert
Schweitzer Prize at the Kennedy Center
Honors, and membership in the French Legion
of Honor, as well as major honors from Brazil
and Haiti; and
WHEREAS, after 1967, Dunham lived
most of each year in East St. Louis, Illinois,
where she struggled to bring the arts to the
area. She set up an eclectic compound of artists
from around the globe, including Harry
Belafonte. Among the free classes offered were
dance, African hair-braiding and woodcarving,
conversational Creole, Spanish, French and
Swahili and more traditional subjects such as
aesthetics and social science; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
deliberations to recognize the Katherine
Dunham Centennial Celebration which will
recognize the many achievements and
contributions of Katherine Dunham to the
City of St. Louis and we further direct the
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this
Resolution across the minutes of these
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative
copy to the end that it may be presented to
