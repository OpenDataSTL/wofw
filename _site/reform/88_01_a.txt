      In accordance with Ordinance No. 65597,    
 the St. Louis Living Wage Ordinance

 the City of St. Louis has determined that the   
 following living wage rates are now in effect   
 for employees of covered contracts:             
       1) Where health benefits are defined in   
 the Ordinance are provided to the employee,     
 the living wage rate is $10.05 per hour (130%   
 of the federal poverty level income guideline   
 for a family of three); and                     
       2) Where health benefits as defined in    
 the Ordinance are not provided to the           
 employee, the living wage rate is $12.64 per
