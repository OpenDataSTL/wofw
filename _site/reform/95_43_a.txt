 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term

Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration

with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.

     Bidders are also advised that the State       
of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under

Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration

with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.

the contract provisions related to the Living

the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and

works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under
