 Roha USA has just finished undergoing a $5        
 million expansion in the City of St. Louis; and   
       WHEREAS, this expansion has                 
 increased their capacities in almost every        
 aspect. Roha has introduced new technology        
 to increase efficiency, reduce employee efforts   
 through ergonomics, and to give back to the       
 community; and                                    
      WHEREAS, during the re-design Roha           
 repurposed its warehouse capacity into            
 manufacturing square footage, increasing the      
 production area by over 400%. Also, Roha          
 acquired a second location, to increase           
 warehouse capacity by 200% from before;

 to further increase production. This increase     
 in production will in turn lead to more jobs.     
 They are expecting about 5 new employees a        
 year for the next 5 years. The expansion and      
 redesign of the facilities also encompasses       
 employee areas. The areas outside of the          
 manufacturing area affected were the break        
 room, the locker room and the warehouse           
 office; and                                       
       WHEREAS, Roha's non business motto          
 is "To care and safeguard the environment"        
 and has been proven time and time again.          
 Recently. they have completed a 25 MW solar       
 plant in India; and                               
       WHEREAS, in addition to conserving          
 energy Roha has started a university, donates     
 to hospitals, and believes education will lead    
 the future. The JJT University is to provide      
 knowledge and educate students in science,        
 technology and in other areas so that instead     
 of job-seekers they become providers/creators     
 of jobs.                                          
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

           Resolution No. 112                       
                Bradd Young                         
      WHEREAS, Bradd Young is a R&B/                
Hip-Hop inspired music powerhouse who               
defies age and defines class with his lush vocals,  
hypnotic beats and melodic keys, all while          
continuing to cultivate his craft; and              
      WHEREAS, with humble beginnings in            
St. Louis, Bradd didn't settle for less when it     
came to pursuing a career in music. He started      
playing the drums and piano as a child while        
attending Emerson Elementary School. In high        
school, he was a leader in choir and eventually     
became the co-founder of the community choir        
and majored in classical piano. After graduating    
from Berkeley High School in 1997, Bradd            
picked up the guitar; and                           
      WHEREAS, by age 16, Bradd was                 
putting together tracks for Epic Records &          
Heineken's Red Star Sounds soundtrack. After        
high school Bradd moved to Atlanta to further       
pursue his passion of being successful in the       
music business and even landed the                  
opportunity to work with the late Lisa              
"Lefteye" Lopez from the multi-platinum             
female group TLC and a host of other artists;       
and                                                 
      WHEREAS, standing as one of the few           
solo artists in the industry who still fuses        
precise      choreography         with    live      
instrumentation, Bradd's on-stage                   
performance is vivacious, yet versatile as he       
flexes his range and remaining true to his          
artistry. With his magnetic yet mystical            
personality, Bradd has managed to keep              
himself grounded by supporting other artists        
as they try to get to the next level; and           
      WHEREAS, never staying stagnant,              
Bradd has also shared his writing and               
producing skills with industry giants such as:      
Akon, Teddy Riley, Bone Thugs & Harmony,            
Kelly Rowland, Maino, Makeba Riddick,               
Jibbs, Tyra B, Yolanda Adams, Yo Gotti and          
The St. Lunatics; and WHEREAS, along                
with his production partner Prettyboy, Bradd        
continues to manage, produce and develop a          
team of extreme talent on their RockHouse           
Music imprint. RockHouse is a company               
that promotes artist creativity and ownership.      
Their company tagline is "We follow history,        
never trends"; and                                  
     WHEREAS, Bradd's vision of                     
RockHouse is more than a dream, it's now a          
force to be reckoned with. With his latest          
single "Grown Man" racing up the charts in          
growing markets, there is no doubt that Bradd       
Young is destined for greatness.                    
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT                              
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 service and leadership to their neighborhood          
 of St. Louis Hills and the City of St. Louis;         
 and                                                   
       WHEREAS, in 1991, Mike and Geralyn,             
 working with a small group of community               
 leaders, began planning for a small 5k run with       
 the objective of raising funds for the upkeep         
 and beautification of Francis Park. Despite           
 the early naysayers, the event was a success          
 and enthusiastically accepted in St. Louis            
 Hills; and                                            
       WHEREAS, over the years, the              
 Banahan family added three more run             
 volunteers, their children, Kelly, Kerry and    
 Maggie. The entire family has devoted           
 countless hours and great talent to building    
 the Run for the Hills to the successful event it
 is today. They have volunteered in every role   
 needed for the execution of the event which     
 includes attracting event sponsors, setting up  
 street barricades, working the finish line,     
 organizing and distributing run packets and t-  
 shirts, course set-up and lining up the         
 volunteers; and                                 
       WHEREAS, during the 20 years that         
 Mike and Geralyn have led Run for the Hills,    
 over $200,000 of improvements have been         
 made to Francis and Willmore Parks and          
 thousands of athletes have discovered a true    
 gem in the city- St. Louis Hills. Because of    
 their hard work and help from many              
 volunteers, people are able to enjoy the many   
 amenities of the neighborhood parks. The        
 projects fully or partially funded by the Run   
 for the Hills include new trees, plants, and    
 flowers planted annually, beautiful gardens     
 on the corners and interior of the park, new    
 playground equipment, repairs to the lily       
 pond and the gorgeous lily pond plants,         
 renovations to the handball and racquetball     
 courts, new sidewalks, tuck pointing the steps  
 and bridges in the creek area and adding a part 
 time summer worker at the park. We are          
 thankful to Mike's and Geralyn's vision and     
 dedication over the years which has kept the    
 neighborhood park the beautiful place it was    
 designed to be; and                             
       WHEREAS, the Banahans are                 
 exceptional members of this community           
 whose service to the residents of the St. Louis 
 Hills neighborhood and to all of the citizens   
 of this city is greatly appreciated.
