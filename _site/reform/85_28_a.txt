Re: City of St. Louis Planning Commission         
Review of Proposed Chapter 99 Blighting           
Study and Redevelopment Plan - South              
Downtown Redevelopment Project Area               
Dear Ms. Divis:                                   
     This is to notify you and the Board of       
Aldermen that the City of St. Louis Planning      
Commission approved a resolution at its           
Meeting on Wednesday, October 2, 2002             
regarding a proposed Chapter 99 Blighting         
Study and Redevelopment Plan - the South          
Downtown Redevelopment Project Area (the          
new baseball stadium and Ballpark Village).       
      This notification is in keeping with        
Section Eight, Sub-Paragraph 6 of Ordinance

100 and 353 RSMo shall be submitted to the        
Planning Commission for its recommendation        
as to conformity with the Comprehensive           
Plan. No ordinance adopting any such              
blighting study or redevelopment plan shall       
be adopted over the negative recommendation       
of the Planning Commission unless it receives     
the affirmative vote of the majority of all the   
members of the Board of Aldermen."                
      Resolution No. PDA-120-02-RDM, a            
copy of which is enclosed, was approved by        
the following vote:                               
       Ayes - 12, Noes - 0, Abstain - 1, Present
