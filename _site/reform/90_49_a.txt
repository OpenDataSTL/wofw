       WHEREAS, St. Louis City Hall, which          
 has housed city government since 1898, is a        
 landmark by appearance, reputation and city        
 designation. The building is representative of     
 the French Renaissance Revival style, similar      
 to the Paris Hotel de Ville, the City Hall of      
 Paris;                                             
      WHEREAS, on April 4, 1889, an                 
 ordinance was passed to authorize the              
 commission to advertise for the building. City     
 Hall was officially completed on November          
 5, 1904 at a total cost of $1,787,159.16;          
       WHEREAS, City Hall was praised for           
 its "splendid architectural compositions" and      
 called "an impressive period piece of              
 craftsmanship" upon its completion;              
       WHEREAS, City Hall has been                
 previously designated as a City Landmark and     
 has a significant historical interest or value as
 part of the development, heritage or cultural    
 characteristics of the City of St. Louis; and    
       WHEREAS, it is vital and necessary         
 that City Hall keep its historical character and 
 integrity and not undergo any adverse effects    
 when remodeling, constructing, adding,           
 eliminating, altering, repairing, rehabilitating,
 maintaining, stabilizing, remediating hazardous  
 materials and providing handicapped access       
 as required by law under the Americans with      
 Disabilities Act;                                
        WHEREAS, it is of the essence that at     
 anytime City Hall undergoes any type of          
 interior renovations, St. Louis City employees   
 and/or contractors are prohibited from           
 destroying, removing, altering any of the        
 original and historical fixtures, fittings and   
 equipment to ensure that St. Louis City Hall     
 remains the beautiful and historical structure   
 it is;                                           
      WHEREAS, St. Louis City Ordinance           
 64689, Part V, Section thirty-nine (39), states  
 "No Owner or other person shall construct,       
 demolish or alter any designated feature or      
 Exterior Architectural Feature with respect to   
 any Improvement situated within an Historic      
 District, or within or part of a Landmark or     
 Landmark Site, nor shall such person cause or    
 permit any such work to be performed upon        
 such property, unless an application shall have  
 been filed with the building commissioner and    
 a permit obtained therefore from the building    
 commissioner."                                   
       WHEREAS, the Board of Public               
 Service's employees, contractors, or             
 consultants are required to obtain approval      
 by the staff of the Cultural Resources Office    
 prior to any interior renovation. Any disputes   
 arising between the Board of Public Service      
 and the staff of the Cultural Resources Office   
 will be appealed to the Preservation Board. If   
 that decision is disputed by either the staff of 
 the Cultural Resources Office or the Board of    
 Public Service it will be resolved by vote by    
 the Board of Public Service at its regular public
 hearing. Appeals from decisions of the           
 Preservation Board shall be followed pursuant    
 to the provisions of St. Louis City Ordinance    
 64689, Part VII, Section fifty-three.

 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our       
deliberations to urge all city employees to

fixtures, fittings and equipment to ensure that    
St. Louis City Hall remain a beautiful and         
historical structure.

           Resolution No. 339                      
 RESOLUTION URGING CESSATION                       
 OF COMBAT OPERATIONS IN IRAQ                      
 AND THE RETURN OF U.S. TROOPS                     
     WHEREAS, the authorization for the            
use of military force against Iraq, Resolution     
of 2002, was passed by the U.S. Congress on        
October 11, 2002, and that Public Law 107-         
243 cited Iraq's possession of "weapons of         
mass destruction"as one of the primary             
reasons for the use of U.S. military power         
against Iraq; and                                  
      WHEREAS, the United States initiated         
combat operations in Iraq on March 19, 2003        
in part to find the reported weapons of mass       
destruction and since no weapons of mass           
destruction were found, President Bush             
officially declared an end to the search for       
these weapons in Iraq on January 12, 2005;         
and                                                
      WHEREAS, hundreds of thousands of            
members of the United States Armed Forces          
have served with honor and distinction in Iraq     
with more than 4,000 of them having been           
killed and more than 60,000 of them having         
been wounded in substantially accomplishing        
the stated purpose of the United States for        
entering Iraq, clearly determining that Iraq is    
free of any supposed arsenal of weapons of         
mass destruction and toppling the government       
of Saddam Hussein; and                             
       WHEREAS, the United States military         
 occupation of Iraq has placed significant         
 strains on the capacity of the United States      
 Armed Forces including the National Guard,        
 both active duty and reserve; and                 
      WHEREAS, the U.S. State Department           
 noted that the Iraqi Security Forces number       
 more than 355,000 troops as of January 2008       
 and are growing in number and capability          
 daily; and                                        
       WHEREAS, nearly $500 billion has            
 been appropriated by Congress to fund             
 military operations and reconstruction in Iraq,   
 with Missouri residents' share now exceeding      
 estimates of $7.5 billion and St. Louis'          
 residents share now exceeding $335 million as     
 calculated by the National Priorities Project;    
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, in February 2007                   
 congressional hearings determined that nearly     
 $10 billion of the monies expended on the war     
 effort in Iraq have been "mismanaged and          
 wasted"; and                                      
       WHEREAS, $4.6 billion in tax dollars        
 paid to the Halliburton Corporation and the       
 former Halliburton division, KBR, were            
 deemed "unreasonable and unsupportable" by        
 Pentagon auditors and according to the            
 Brookings Institute Iraq Index, hundreds of       
 millions of tax payers monies have                
 disappeared due to military equipment being       
 "lost and unaccounted for"; and                   
       WHEREAS, the funds spent by St.             
 Louis taxpayers on the war and occupation in      
 Iraq could have provided Head Start for one       
 year for 45,562 children; or medical insurance    
 for one year for 33,429 children; or 1,996        
 public school teachers for one year; or 939       
 affordable housing units, according to the        
 National Priorities Project; and                  
      WHEREAS, the war and continued               
 occupation of Iraq has resulted in the            
 devastation of Iraq's physical and social         
 infrastructure and led to widespread and          
 continuous resistance to U.S. occupation that     
 threatens the lives of Iraqi civilians and the    
 men and women who compose the ranks of            
 U.S. Armed forces; and                            
      WHEREAS, the presence of United              
 States forces in Iraq and the alleged torture of  
 prisoners at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay,          
 Cuba and other facilities have inflamed anti-     
 American passions in significant portions of      
 the Muslim world and increased the terrorist      
 threat to United States citizens, both at home    
 and abroad; and                                   
      WHEREAS, the continued US                    
 occupation of Iraq has precipitated the fastest-  
 growing refugee crisis in the world displacing    
 nearly one fifth of that country's population  
 either internally or externally, in addition to
 the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi   
 civilians according to studies by the British  
 medical journal, The Lancet and the Johns      
 Hopkins University School of Public Health;    
 and                                            
       WHEREAS, such destabilization and        
 destruction is fueling instability in the      
 surrounding region which threatens the         
 security of all Americans with various U.S.    
 polls, including media tabulations, showing    
 that less than half of the American people     
 support the war.                               
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED, that the St. Louis City Board        
 of Aldermen urges the United States Congress   
 and the President to immediately commence      
 an orderly and rapid withdrawal of United      
 States military personnel from Iraq, while     
 assisting the Iraqi people to rebuild and      
 reconstruct and that the financial resources   
 used for the war be redirected to address the  
 urgent needs of America's great urban centers, 
 the most vulnerable portions of the U.S.       
 population and to address urgent domestic      
 health, housing and education crises that      
 America faces and further directs the Clerk of 
 this Board to prepare a fitting copy of this   
 resolution so that in the end it may be        
 presented to those deemed appropriate by its   
 sponsor.
