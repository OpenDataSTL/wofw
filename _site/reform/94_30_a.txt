 Bicycle & Pedestrian Federation, the Missouri       
 Safe Routes to School Network, Trailnet and

       WHEREAS, a lack of physical activity          
plays a leading role in rising rates of obesity,

      WHEREAS, an important role for              
parents and caregivers is to teach children

the difficulties and dangers that children face   
on their trip to school each day and the health   
and environmental risks related to physical       
inactivity and air pollution; and                 
     WHEREAS, community members and               
leaders should make a plan to make immediate      
changes to enable Missouri's children to safely   
walk and bicycle in our communities; and          
      WHEREAS, children, parents and              
community leaders around the world are            
joining together to walk to school and evaluate   
walking and bicycling conditions in their         
communities; and                                  
      WHEREAS,          Walk and Bicycle to       
School Month in October and Walk and

Safe Route to Schools programs across the         
United States and throughout the world; and       
      WHEREAS, the General Assembly of            
the state of Missouri has passed and the

       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.      
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.                                       
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations      
 are available upon request from Carol Shepard,     
 at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at              
 http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.             
      Bidders are also advised that the State       
 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
 the prevailing rate for any work done under        
 the contract by the contractor or by any           
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).
