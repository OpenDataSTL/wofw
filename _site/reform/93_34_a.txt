      Northwest Academy of Law                    
       WHEREAS, we have been apprised             
 that Northwest Academy of Law is receiving       
 a 2010 Spirit of Justice Award. A Spirit of      
 Justice Award recognizes lawyers and non-        
 lawyers who have demonstrated                    
 accomplishment, leadership and integrity in      
 fostering and maintaining the rule of law and    
 in facilitation and promoting improvement of     
 the administration of justice; and               
      WHEREAS, created in 2005, the               
 Northwest Academy of Law is a "school of         
 choice" magnet-type school in the St. Louis      
 Public School System. As its name suggest,       
 the Academy is an alternative high school with   
 a specific focus on the legal profession; and    
      WHEREAS, the curriculum is designed         
 with this in mind, as well as college            
 preparation, concentrating on writing, public    
 speaking, debate and basic knowledge of the      
 law. In addition to law-related classes, the     
 school offers internships through the St. Louis  
 Circuit Court where participants are able to     
 shadow judges, prosecutors, sheriff's deputies   
 and jury coordinators; and                       
       WHEREAS, interestingly, this school        
 is not just for aspiring lawyers. In fact, many  
 of the school's first students picked Northwest  
 simply because it was close to their homes,      
 and never even considered becoming a lawyer;     
 and                                              
      WHEREAS, however, many of the              
 school's first graduates (a class of 75 who     
 graduated in June of this year), are planning   
 on attending college. Furthermore, while a      
 handful of students are planning on attending   
 law school, a fair share also plan on pursuing  
 law-related careers including law enforcement;  
 and                                             
       WHEREAS, no doubt this career             
 trajectory has been nurtured by the Northwest   
 Academy of Law curriculum; students are         
 quick to mention a new direction and focus      
 along with overcoming challenges and            
 considering new options for their future.       
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to          
 recognize the achievements of Northwest         
 Academy of Law and we further direct the        
 Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this    
 Resolution across the minutes of these          
 proceedings and to prepare a copy for           
 presentation, at a time and place deemed        
 appropriate by the Sponsor.

      WHEREAS, Earl Wilson Jr., founder of       
 the St. Louis Gateway Classic Sports            
 Foundation and a legendary advocate for the     
 African-American community in St. Louis,        
 passed away approximately 8 a.m. Friday,        
 October 29, 2010 at his home in St. Louis;      
 and                                             
      WHEREAS, Mr. Wilson was born the           
 middle son in a hardscrabble, tight-knit family.
 He grew up at 11th and Carr streets near        
 downtown, just blocks from where he would       
 eventually build his foundation and sports      
 complex, at Martin Luther King Drive and        
 20th. Mr. Wilson fought successfully in the     
 ring, winning a Golden Gloves boxing            
 championship; and

 in the St. Louis Public Schools (graduating     
 from Vashon High School), Harris Stowe          
 Teachers College and Lincoln University.        
 Before establishing the legacy of the Gateway   
 Classic, he served as a captain in the U.S.     
 Army Corp of Engineers and worked his way       
 up at IBM; in his final position, he led a $1.4 
 billion operation with more than 100 salesmen;  
 and                                             
      WHEREAS, 108 scholars attended             
 higher education at a historically black college
 or university through a total of $2.8 million in
 Gateway Classic scholarships, using funds       
raised primarily through an annual fall football      
game. The foundation that he built hosts an           
annual football game between two black college        
teams at the Edward Jones Dome; and                   
      WHEREAS, Mr. Wilson is mourned                  
by dozens of African Americans of high                
achievement who have been enshrined in the            
Gateway Classic Walk of Fame, which honors            
such St. Louis-area legends as former                 
Congressman William L. Clay, Jackie-Joyner            
Kersee, Ozzie Smith, The 5th Dimension and            
comedian Dick Gregory. He is also mourned             
by hundreds of community advocates and                
activists who used the Gateway Classic                
facility as a safe haven and organizing hub.          
Mr. Wilson's foundation also provided food            
for thousands of people at various times              
during the year and toys for children at              
Christmas; and                                        
     WHEREAS, his wife, Billie H. Wilson,             
daughter Denise Wilson and daughter Theresa           
Anderson were with Mr. Wilson when he                 
passed. Other survivors include his daughters         
Stacey Wilson McMahon and Kimberly

 political subdivision pursuant to and in            
 accordance with the TDD Act for the sole            
 purpose of funding the Transportation Project       
 (as defined in the Petition and Exhibit C,          
 attached hereto and incorporated herein)         
 through the imposition of a transportation       
 development district sales tax (the "Sales Tax") 
 at a rate in increments of one-eighth of one     
 percent up to a maximum of one percent for a     
 period of up to forty years from the date on
