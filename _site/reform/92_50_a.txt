in overall clearance rate and issuance rate.

      Mr. Boyd introduced Resolution No.        
 331 and the Clerk was instructed to read same. 
           Resolution No. 331                   
        WHEREAS, it is incumbent upon the       
 Board of Aldermen to express opposition of     
 the efforts to repeal the City of St. Louis'   
 ability to utilize current revenues raised from
 its earning tax to fund city services and      
 expressing its intent to continue levying the  
 current voter approved earnings and profits    
 tax that funds basic and essential public      
 services to people living and working in the   
 City of St. Louis and opposing any legislation,
 initiative or referendum repealing the earnings
 and profits tax without the Board of           
 Aldermen's prior endorsement.                  
       WHEREAS, the citizens of the City of     
 St. Louis have twice supported the levying of  
 the earnings and profits tax; and              
       WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax    
 is the largest source of revenue funding the   
 annual City Budget approximately $140          
 million per year-providing 31% of General      
 Fund Revenues and 20% of all Governmental      
 Fund Revenues; and                             
       WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax,   
 in whole or in part, funds numerous basic      
 services including but not limited to police   
 and fire protection, trash collection and      
 disposal, street preservation, animal control, 
 illegal dumping, tree trimming, neighborhood   
 preservation and revitalization, dangerous     
 building demolition, weed abatement, and       
 others; and                                    
      WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax     
 provides funding for tax increment financing   
 projects as well as other planning and         
 economic development functions; and            
       WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax    
 contributes to the diversity of the City of St.
 Louis' revenue structure and therefore has the 
 positive effect of moderating revenue declines 
 during economic downturns; and                 
      WHEREAS, over the last 5 year, 10 year    
 and 20 year periods, the earnings tax has      
 experienced compound annual growth rates       
of 2.7 %, 1.9% and 2.2% respectively; City        
sale tax during those same periods half grown     
at rates of 1.4%, 0.2%; and                       
      WHEREAS, a diverse revenue structure        
also collects income from a variety of bases      
thereby no overburdening any particular           
category of taxpayer; and                         
     WHEREAS, the City would need to              
more than double its current sales tax rate, to   
approximately seven and one half percent, to      
compensate for lost earnings and profits tax      
income; and                                       
      WHEREAS, an increase of this size in        
the City sales taxes would push the overall       
sales tax rate in the City of St. Louis over      
twelve percent, which would be considerably       
greater than any other community in the metro     
area; and                                         
      WHEREAS, statutory authorization            
would be needed to propose an increase in the     
local sales tax; and                              
      WHEREAS, the City would need to             
increase its aggregate existing total property    
tax by approximately two and a half times         
over $3 per $100 assessed validation to replace   
lost earnings and profits tax income; and         
     WHEREAS, the impact of such a                
increasing the property tax levy would            
annually cost the owner of a $100,000.00          
home and $15,000.00 automobile and                
additional $750.00 and the owner of a             
$200,000.00 home and $35,000.00 automobile        
an additional $1,560.00; and                      
     WHEREAS, the City would need to              
receive statutory authorization to propose an     
increase in its general property tax rate beyond  
the current limit; and                            
      WHEREAS, the loss of the earnings and       
profits tax would require the City to file a      
"material event notice" regarding its bond        
portfolio, and this would have substantial        
repercussions in the bond market unless the       
City can present an acceptable plan for the       
replacement of this income; and                   
       WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax      
is effectively a modestly progressive tax, while  
the sales tax is effectively regressive, and the  
property tax is effectively proportional; and     
     WHEREAS, local earnings or income            
taxes are not uncommon among the nation's         
largest cities as one in four large urban cities  
have an earnings or income tax; and               
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis'              
earnings tax is among the nation's lowest at      
one percent with a national average of two        
percent and a high of 4.54 percent. Only one      
U.S. city has a lower earnings/income tax rate,   
0.7%, than the City of St. Louis. By              
 comparison, the Missouri state income tax             
 rate is six percent on taxable income exceeding       
 $9,000.00; and                                        
       WHEREAS, the earnings and profits tax           
 receives some of its income from non-residents        
 who earn their income in the City of St. Louis        
 and thereby benefit from public safety,               
 transportation, maintenance, preservation, and        
 other basic services and increase the demand          
 for those services;                                   
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                              
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                  
 the City of St. Louis that:                           
        Section 1. That it is recognized that          
 the provision of basic and essential public           
 services to persons living and working in the         
 City of St. Louis requires a reliable means of        
 annual income and that the earnings and profits       
 tax is the single largest component of a diverse      
 revenue structure that funds those services.          
      Section 2. That, all things considered,          
 the Board of Aldermen believes that the               
 earnings and profits tax is an integral, equitable,   
 and complementary component of its overall            
 revenue structure and should continue to be           
 levied for the foreseeable future to insure the       
 continued and reliable funding and provision          
 of public services.                                   
       Section 3. That the Board of Aldermen           
 hereby opposes any legislation, initiative or         
 referendum, which would repeal the earnings           
 and profits tax without the Board of                  
 Aldermen's prior endorsement of such action,          
 and that such action should be withdrawn              
 forthwith until due consideration and                 
 endorsement has been granted.
