            Resolution No. 133                         
      WHEREAS, we pause in our                         
 deliberations to recognize the 100th                  
 Anniversary of the Federal Bureau of                  
 Investigations; and                                   
       WHEREAS, the FBI, originally created            
 as the Bureau of Investigation, was created on        
 July 26, 1908 to assist the Attorney General          
 in investigating criminal cases. Attorney             
 General Bonaparte appointed a force of                
 Special Agents within the Department of               
 Justice. Accordingly, ten former Secret Service       
 employees and a number of Department of               
 Justice peonage (i.e., compulsory servitude)          
 investigators became Special Agents of the            
 Department of Justice. On July 26, 1908,              
 Bonaparte ordered them to report to Chief             
 Examiner Stanley W. Finch. This action is             
 celebrated as the beginning of the FBI; and           
      WHEREAS, the first major expansion               
 in Bureau jurisdiction came in June 1910 when         
 the Mann ("White Slave") Act was passed,              
 making it a crime to transport women over             
 state lines for immoral purposes. It also             
 provided a tool by which the federal                  
 government could investigate criminals who            
 evaded state laws but had no other federal            
 violations; and                                       
      WHEREAS, on May 10, 1924, J. Edgar        
 Hoover was selected to head the Bureau of      
 Investigation. When Hoover took over, the      
 Bureau of Investigation had approximately      
 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents    
 who worked in field offices in nine cities. By 
 the end of the decade, there were              
 approximately 30 field offices, with           
 Divisional headquarters in New York,           
 Baltimore, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Chicago,       
 Kansas City, San Antonio, San Francisco, and   
 Portland. He also scheduled regular            
 inspections of the operations in all field     
 offices. Then, in January 1928, Hoover         
 established a formal training course for new   
 Agents, including the requirement that New     
 Agents had to be in the 25-35 year range to    
 apply. He also returned to the earlier         
 preference for Special Agents with law or      
 accounting experience; and                     
       WHEREAS, during the early and mid-       
 1930s several crucial decisions solidified the 
 Bureau's position as the nation's premier law  
 enforcement agency. Responding to the          
 kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, in 1932,     
 Congress passed a federal kidnapping statute.  
 Then in May and June 1934, with gangsters      
 like John Dillinger evading capture by crossing
 over state lines, it passed a number of federal
 crime laws that significantly enhanced the     
 Bureau's jurisdiction. In the wake of the      
 Kansas City Massacre, Congress also gave       
 Bureau Agents statutory authority to carry     
 guns and make arrests; and                     
       WHEREAS, since 1917, the FBI and its     
 predecessor agencies had investigated          
 suspected acts of espionage and sabotage. In   
 1939 and again in 1943, Presidential directives
 had authorized the FBI to carry out            
 investigations of threats to national security.
 This role was clarified and expanded under     
 Presidents Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower.    
 Any public or private agency or individual     
 with information about subversive activities   
 was urged to report it to the FBI. Later,      
 executive orders from both Presidents Truman   
 and Eisenhower gave the FBI responsibility     
 for investigating allegations of disloyalty    
 among federal employees. In these cases, the   
 agency requesting the investigation made the   
 final determination; the FBI only conducted    
 the investigation and reported the results.    
 Many suspected and convicted spies, such as    
 Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, had been federal   
 employees. Therefore, background               
 investigations were considered to be just as   
 vital as cracking major espionage cases; and   
       WHEREAS, the turning point in federal    
 civil rights actions occurred in the summer of 
 1964, with the murder of voting registration   
 workers Michael Schwerner, Andrew              
 Goodman, and James Chaney near                 
Philadelphia, Mississippi. At the Department       
of Justice's request, the FBI conducted the        
investigation as it had in previous, less-         
publicized racial incidents. Only after 1966,      
when the Supreme Court made it clear that          
federal law could be used to prosecute civil       
rights violations, were seven men found guilty.    
By the late 1960s, the confluence of               
unambiguous federal authority and local            
support for civil rights prosecutions allowed      
the FBI to play an influential role in enabling    
African Americans to vote, serve on juries,        
and use public accommodations on an equal          
basis. Other civil rights investigations included  
the assasination of Martin Luther King, Jr.,       
with the arrest of James Earl Ray, and the         
murder of Medger Evers, Mississippi Field          
Secretary of the NAACP, with the arrest of         
Byron De La Beckwith who, after two                
acquittals, was finally found guilty in 1994;      
and                                                
      WHEREAS, throughout the 1980s, the           
illegal drug trade severely challenged the         
resources of American law enforcement. To          
ease this challenge, in 1982 the Attorney          
General gave the FBI concurrent jurisdiction       
with the Drug Enforcement Administration           
(DEA) over narcotics violations in the United      
States. The expanded Department of Justice         
attention to drug crimes resulted in the           
confiscation of millions of dollars in controlled  
substances, the arrests of major narcotics         
figures, and the dismantling of important drug     
rings; and                                         
      WHEREAS, on September 4, 2001,               
former U.S. Attorney Robert S. Mueller, III        
was sworn in as FBI Director (2001 to              
present) with a specific mandate to upgrade        
the Bureau's information technology                
infrastructure, to address records management      
issues, and to enhance FBI foreign                 
counterintelligence analysis and security in the   
wake of the damage done by former Special          
Agent and convicted spy Robert Hanssen.            
Within days of his entering on duty, however,      
the September 11 terrorist attacks were            
launched against New York and Washington.          
Director Mueller led the FBI's massive             
investigative efforts in partnership with all      
U.S. law enforcement, the federal government,      
and allies overseas. On October 26, 2001,          
President George W. Bush signed into law the       
U.S. Patriot Act, which granted new provisions     
to address the threat of terrorism, and Director   
Mueller accordingly accepted on behalf of the      
Bureau responsibility for protecting the           
American people against future terrorist           
attacks. On May 29, 2002, the Attorney             
General issued revised investigative guidelines    
to assist the Bureau's counterterrorism efforts    
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT                             
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to
