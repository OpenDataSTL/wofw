the late Bishop Watson. He attended Sunday

started among Black men during the War of        
Independence, when Prince Hall and 14 other      
free Black men were initiated into Lodge #441    
attached to the British Army at Castle William   
Boston Harbor in 1775. When the British          
Army left Boston, Lodge #441 granted Prince      
Hall and his brother's authority to meet as a    
Lodge but they could not confer degrees nor      
perform any other Masonic Work. In 1784          
after nine years of limited privileges, Prince   
Hall petitioned the Grand Lodge of England       
for a warrant or charter. The Charter was        
granted on September 28, 1784 and Prince         
Hall became the first Master of the Lodge.       
Today the Prince Hall fraternity has over        
4,500 Lodges worldwide, forming 44               
independent jurisdictions with membership

Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration

the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.
