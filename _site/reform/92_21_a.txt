This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
work pursuant to a contract executed between       
the successful bidder and the City must be         
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.

    Bidders are also advised that the State        
of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any
