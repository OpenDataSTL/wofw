       WHEREAS, Falun Gong (Falun Dafa),               
 a traditional Chinese self cultivation practice,

 "eradication" campaign against Falun Gong,            
 hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong

 since 1999 have put to death a large but              
 unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of             
 conscience. Their vital organs, including hearts,   
 kidneys, livers and corneas, were virtually         
 simultaneously seized involuntarily for sale        
 at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who        
 normally face long waits for voluntary              
 donations of such organs in their home              
 countries." and                                     
       WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of          
 free and democratic nations to condemn the          
 act of crimes against humanity and shameless        
 disregard for human life wherever they occur;
