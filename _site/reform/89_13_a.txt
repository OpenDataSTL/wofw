        WHEREAS, The National United                 
 Merchants Beverage Association, also known          
 as NUMBA, is the largest African American           
 retail organization in the country and was born     
 nearly 32 years ago out of the necessity to         
 insure that African Americans were adequately

 Beverage Industry; and

 tobacco products without adversely affecting        
 the health and welfare of the general public;

 the successful bidder and the City must be       
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage

 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.

 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and        
 Regulations.
