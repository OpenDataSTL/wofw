       FRANKIE MUSE FREEMAN                      
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that        
 on February 8, 2008, Delta Sigma Theta          
 Sorority will honor Frankie Muse Freeman as     
 the 14th National President of Delta Sigma      
 Theta Sorority from 1967-1970; and              
      WHEREAS, Frankie Muse Freeman              
 (Soror Freeman) was elected the fourteenth      
 National President of Delta Sigma Theta at its  
 29th National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio    
 in August 1967. Before being elected National   
 President, she had served as National First     
 Vice-President; and                             
      WHEREAS, in her biography, A Song          
 of Faith and Hope, Soror Freeman noted that     
 the Cincinnati convention had a number of       
 highlights; a commendation for Delta's Teen-    
 Lift program from Vice-President Hubert         
 Humphrey and a call to action by Texas state    
 senator Barbara Jordan to join in helping to    
 eliminate racism; and                           
      WHEREAS, one of Soror Freeman's            
 goals as president was to have every Delta      
 become more involved in government at all       
 levels, a goal based on her belief that every   
 individual should be involved in social action  
 and to personally let legislators know what     
 laws they wanted enacted; and                   
      WHEREAS, at the Baltimore                  
 convention, Delta's largest convention since    
 the first, Soror Freeman was elected to a       
 second two-year term. It was at that            
 convention that she called for Deltas to push   
for enforcement of legislation that impacted       
civil rights; and

supplementary statement, in her position as        
the lone woman on the US Commission on             
Civil Rights (1967), to the "Racial Isolation      
in the Public Schools" report. That statement,     
in which she wrote, "For we are now on a           
collision course which may produce within          
our borders two alienated and unequal nations      
confronting each other across a widening gulf      
created by a dual educational system based         
upon income and race" was the impetus for          
her call to convention in Baltimore; and           
      WHEREAS, Soror Freeman was wife              
to Shelby T. Freeman, Jr. and is mother to         
Shelby Patricia. During her presidency, she        
was Associate General Counsel of the St.           
Louis Housing and Land Clearance Authorities       
and served on the Board of Directors of the        
National Council of Negro Women. She has           
also held memberships in the St. Louis Branch      
NAACP, YWCA of Metropolitan St. Louis,             
League of Women Voters, American and               
National Bar Associations and the Mound            
City Bar Association

 Honorable Samuel L. MooreAlderman 4th Ward       
            Resolution No. 333                    
       WHEREAS, we have been apprised that        
 on Saturday February 9, 2008 James A.            
 Hathman will be recognized for his 47 years      
 as an Ironworker; and                            
       WHEREAS, Jim is a third generation         
 Ironworker, initiated on July 1, 1961, who by    
 his less than regular attendance at work, his    
 not so good safety record and his generally      
 low productivity rate, quickly developed a       
 reputation as an Ironworker whose talents        
 might better be suited to holding elective office
 than working on the iron, so it was no surprise  
 that in 1969 he was elected to the executive     
 board and has since remained an elected officer  
 of the union including the positions of          
 Business Agent, Business Manager, and            
 General Organizer and President of the Iron      
 Workers District Council of St. Louis; and       
       WHEREAS, Jim's management style            
 made him a legend among his fellow elected       
 office holders, it can be summarized by taking   
 credit for their work while hanging around       
 Zia's, Biggies, or one of St. Louis' other fine  
 drinking establishments; and                     
      WHEREAS, Jim is widely credited for         
 personally creating the most union man hours     
 of any union official in St. Louis history,      
 unfortunately these were not ironworker          
 hours, but were for the beer bottlers and        
 brewers union; and                               
      WHEREAS, in 2000 Jim was selected           
 as Port Council's Labor Man of the Year, a       
 surprise to everyone, as this honor is usually   
 bestowed on men of great accomplishment;         
 and                                              
      WHEREAS, Jim during retirement,             
 plans to pursue his volunteer work in boxing,    
 wherefore it was in the ring that he earned so   
 much distinction for the large number of         
 punches he blocked with his face, and the        
 impact those punches have had on his             
 cognitive abilities.                             
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our       
 deliberation to recognize the many               
 achievement of Jim Hathman in his 47 year        
 career as an Ironworker and particularly for     
 his sense of humor that he shared with those     
 whom he worked and the loyalty he showed         
 to those who contributed to his success, we      
further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread   
a commemorative copy to the end that it may        
be presented to our honoree at a time and          
place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
