 Johnson; and                                      
       WHEREAS, his parents instilled in him       
 that hard work pays off and that he should

 chores, yard work, etc., he was given a car by    
 one of the neighbors because they loved him

 neighborhood doing landscaping work, cutting      
 grass, cleaning the alley, changing brakes on     
 someone's car, playing catch with his son,        
 anything that the doctor suggested that he not    
 do because of his condition, but he never let it  
 keep him from being him; and

 has been asked to be in charge of distribution    
 of food and each time he has gone above and       
 beyond to make sure all was in order. He is       
 known to be reliable and dependable and           
 follows through on whatever task he agrees to     
 take on; and                                      
      WHEREAS, last year, Ronald was               
 blessed with a kidney transplant and he           
 deserves to be recognized for his willingness     
 to volunteer in helping in his community          
 although he was sick.

            FIRST READING OF                         
              RESOLUTIONS                            
      Mr. Troupe introduced Resolution No.           
 228 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.      
            Resolution No. 228                       
     WHEREAS, more than 20,400                       
 communities across the country have chosen          
to participate in the National Flood Insurance    
Program (NFIP), and FEMA makes flood              
insurance available to their residents and        
businesses; and                                   
      WHEREAS, Congress established the           
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to        
address both the need for flood insurance and     
the need to lessen the devastating                
consequences of flooding. The goals of the        
program are twofold: to protect communities       
from potential flood damage through               
floodplain management, and to provide people      
with flood insurance. For decades, the NFIP       
has been offering flood insurance to              
homeowners, renters and business owners,          
with the one condition that their communities     
adopt and enforce measures to help reduce         
the consequences of flooding; and                 
     WHEREAS, if a community chooses              
not to participate, flood insurance is not        
available from the NFIP. Moreover, if a           
President declares a disaster as a result of      
flooding, federal financial assistance will not   
be available for the permanent repair or          
reconstruction of insurable buildings. If the     
community applies and is accepted into the        
NFIP within 6 months of a presidential            
disaster declaration, these limitations on        
federal disaster assistance are lifted; and       
      WHEREAS, if a community does not            
participate in the NFIP, a lender can only offer  
a conventional loan and is still required to      
inspect any flood maps to determine flood         
hazard risk and provide notice of such risk.      
Therefore, a lender may require a borrower to     
obtain flood insurance even in the absence of     
a federally mandated requirement; and             
     WHEREAS, in order for a community            
to qualify for the NFIP, all flood plains must    
be mapped. To date, the City of St. Louis has     
not had the flood plain mapping performed;        
and                                               
     WHEREAS, the recent severe flooding          
which occurred in the City of St. Louis           
exemplified the obvious and evident necessity     
of the City of St. Louis to participate in the    
NFIP; and                                         
     WHEREAS, the Metropolitan St. Louis          
Sewer District is responsible to update the       
Public Utilities Committee on the status of       
the insurance claims arising from the             
September 14, 2008 flooding;a nd                  
      WHEREAS, the Metropolitan St. Louis         
Sewer District should be responsible and carry    
the adequate insurance coverage to protect        
their customers.                                  
     NOW, THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our        
 deliberations to call upon the City of St. Louis  
 to provide the immediate funding necessary        
 for the City to have the flood plains mapped      
 so as to be able to participate in the National   
 Flood Insurance Program, for the Metropolitan     
 St. Louis Sewer District to report to the Public  
 Utilities Committee the status of the insurance   
 claims arising from the September 14, 2008        
 flooding and demand that the Metropolitan         
 St. Louis Sewer District carry the necessary      
 insurance to protect their customer's losses      
 in the future.

       WHEREAS, the Statute allows, in

 conditions, the ad valorem taxes which would      
 otherwise be due on subsequent real estate        
 improvements made in Enhanced Enterprise          
 Zone areas to be abated up to 100% for a          
 period not to exceed 25 years from the date       
 the original EEZ area was so designated; for      
 any such subsequent improvements begun

       WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 67350                
 provides for abatement of taxes on real

 Statute, as amended from time to time, subject    
 to certain terms and conditions; and              
       WHEREAS, Ordinance No. 67350

     WHEREAS, Western Blow Pipe, Inc. is          
 expanding its current location; and              
       WHEREAS, it is estimated that the

 approximately $750,000; and will result in       
 four (4) new jobs; and                           
       WHEREAS, EEZ Board has reviewed            
 plans for its subsequent improvements and
