 Honorable Frank Williamson, Alderman 26th Ward     
            Resolution No. 147                      
          Harry Thurston Jones                      
       WHEREAS, Harry Thurston Jones                
 aspired to become a businessman at an early        
 age. He opened his own snow cone business          
 when he was 16 years old in the Ville area of      
 the city. Upon gradation from McBride High         
 School, this business venture enabled him to       
 attend Moler Barber School; and                    
       WHEREAS, in 1958, he steadfastly             
 maintained a laser-like focus on opening           
 another business, now known as Harry's             
 Barber Service located at 4619 Dr Martin           
 Luther King Drive, despite the many barriers       
 that he encountered. He knew that while it         
 was one thing to start a small business; it was    
 another to conceptualize an idea and the see it    
 transform into a successful business. His can-     
 do spirit became contagious, self reinforcing      
 and unstoppable. As a result of his dedication,    
 he has successfully remained in business for       
 more than 50 years; and                            
       WHEREAS, Harry was able to achieve           
 his goal by high goal work performance, work       
 skills, personal motivation, and social            
 networking with diverse, skilled, blue and         
 white collar individuals. His reputation           
 attracted celebrities, politicians, city officials,
city and county police officers, and news         
media. He was contacted by Crimestoppers

      WHEREAS, Gil Scott-Heron looked             
back to the spirituals and work songs, and        
demonstrated like Leadbelly, and Guthrie that     
popular music could be effective as a vehicle     
for serious ideas as a broadside of political     
speech including when he helped to raise          
awareness about the era of Apartheid in South     
Africa with his revolutionary, political          
socially conscious song, "What's the Word,        
Johannesburg"; and

 influenced by poet Langston Hughes, he forged      
 his cadence on his great subject of the everyday   
 struggle of the poor and dispossessed              
 confronting poverty, addiction, government         
 neglect, and sheer unmotivated cruelty-

 chart success, moreover, his most famous work      
 "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", and

 De La Soul, Chuck D (Public Enemy), Dr.            
 Dre, RBX, KRS-One, and Kanye West; and             
       WHEREAS, Gil Scott-Heron's early             
 recordings were consistent with the                
 conventions of jazz poetry with movement           
 that sought to bring the spontaneity of live       
 performance to the reading of verse, he            
 combined social and political commentary           
 with spoken words, and musical grooves             
 exhibiting superior skills for being able to put   
 rhythm and opinion and expressive thought          
 with a sense of voice and musicality together;

              Marion Hudson                        
      WHEREAS, we pause in our                     
 deliberations to note the passing of Marion       
 Hudson on August 7, 2011; and                     
      WHEREAS, Marion Hudson was born              
 February 3, 1932 in Stello, Mississippi. He

 Hudson and Anna Hudson Covington; and             
      WHEREAS, Marion was baptized and             
 served on the deacon board in Gary, Indiana.      
 The Hudson family moved to St. Louis and          
 Marion attended SLPS (Simmons Elementary          
 and Washington Tech). In 1954 he was              
 inducted into the United States Air Force as a    
 private. He received the National Defense         
 Service Medal and an honorable discharge from     
 service in 1960; and                              
       WHEREAS, Marion resided in Gary,            
 Indiana after his discharge, and was employed     
 as a certified welder for the United Steel        
 Company. He moved back to St. Louis to            
 care for his mother and two children. Later,      
 he was united in holy matrimony to Beatrice       
 Thomas for thirty four years on this day of       
 August 12th. With this union they become a

       WHEREAS, Marion was a very wise,            
 strong and independent man. He was a man          
 that believed in respect from the young and       
 old. He was affectionately known as "Papa         
 and Poppy". His passion was to always          
 educate himself and his grandchildren with     
 past history and current events he watched     
 many old western movies and loved watching     
 the game of golf (T. Woods fan). Most of the   
 time he was a very serious man but allowed     
 an unexpected witty comment or joke to spill   
 over. He enjoyed family visits, which were     
 often, but was known to say, as he stood at    
 the front door with it open. "The kitchen is   
 closed and it's time to get out!"; and

 reserves the right to consider criteria other      
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.       
 Among other factors, the Board will consider

 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.

      Bidders are also advised that the State       
 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
 the prevailing rate for any work done under        
 the contract by the contractor or by any           
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).
