District Wives and Widows organization. Her        
passion in life was to serve the Lord with

 that employees could lose their jobs in as few

       WHEREAS, employees say they were

        WHEREAS, on April 19, Pinnacle            
 Entertainment sent notices to the St. Louis

 personnel;" and                                  
       WHEREAS, in addition to providing the      
 skills and experience that have made Pinnacle    
 Entertainment a very successful company that     
 provides great wealth to its investors,

 South County and saw the second anniversary

 their communities; and                           
       WHEREAS, Pinnacle Entertainment

 Urban Development and Zoning.                    
       Seconded by Mr. Ortmann.                   
       Carried unanimously by voice vote.         
      Mr. Boyd introduced Resolution No.          
 62 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.    
            Resolution No. 62                     
     WHEREAS, recently in the 95th                
 General Assembly, 2nd Regular Session, the       
 Missouri Senate and the Missouri House of        
 Representatives passed HCS/SB 739; and           
      WHEREAS, currently under Section            
 320.097 RSMo., upon approval of the Board        
 of Alderman, no employee of a fire department    
 shall, as a condition of employment, be          
 required to reside within a fixed and legally    
 recorded geographical are of the fire            
 department if the only public school district      
 available to the employee within such fire         
 department's geographical area is a public         
 school district that is or had been unaccredited   
 or provisionally accredited in the last five years 
 of such employee's employment.                     
       WHEREAS, under SCS/SB 739, no                
 employee of a fire department who has worked       
 for seven years for shall department shall be      
 required to reside within a fixed and legally      
 recorded geographical area of the fire             
 department if the only public school district      
 available to the employee within such fire         
 department's geographical area is a public         
 school district that is or has been unaccredited   
 or provisionally accredited in the last five years 
 of such employee's employment. Employees           
 who have satisfied the seven year requirement      
 and who choose to reside outside the               
 geographical boundaries of the department          
 shall reside within a one hour response time.      
 HCS/SB 739 removes the provision allowing          
 the voters of St. Louis to vote to supersede       
 that statute and removes the provision             
 requiring employees who reside outside the         
 city to forfeit one percent of his or her salary   
 for the time the employee is not living in the     
 city to offset any lost revenue to the city; and   
       WHEREAS, the Charter of the City of          
 St. Louis was adopted by the vote of the           
 citizens on June 30, 1914. The Charter can         
 only be changed by a vote of the people. Since     
 1914 various parts of the Charter have been        
 changed. The Charter is the plan for the           
 government of the city; and                        
       WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of          
 the Charter of the City of St. Louis states, "In   
 addition to other qualifications required by       
 this charter, except as provided herein below,     
 all officers and employees (in non-temporary,      
 full-time positions) must reside in the City of    
 St. Louis on or before 120 days have elapsed       
 after appointment or, if the officer or employee   
 serves in a working test period as provided        
 by Civil Service Rule, then 120 days after the     
 end of an initial working test period, not to      
 exceed one year, and all employees and officers    
 must maintain residence within the City of         
 St. Louis during the entire tenure of their        
 employment or of their appointment as an           
 officer after said 120-day period and failing or   
 ceasing so to reside, shall forfeit their office or
 employment"; and                                   
       WHEREAS, Article VIII, Section 2 of          
 the Charter was created and later amended by       
 a vote of the citizens of the City of St. Louis    
 not by the Missouri General Assembly. The          
 state legislature clearly does not have the        
 power to waive the residency requirement of        
 the Charter as to any city employees, that         
 power clearly lies with the citizens of the City   
 of St. Louis under the Charter; and                
     WHEREAS, all city employees are                  
governed by the St. Louis City Charter; and           
     WHEREAS, the Missouri General                    
Assembly has usurped the will and the rights          
of the citizens of the City of St. Louis as           
granted by the Charter of the City of St. Louis       
on a purely local matter; and                         
     WHEREAS, at a time when the State of             
the Missouri and City of St. Louis are in a           
financial crisis, this pending legislation could      
be an additional burden on both state and local       
governments with unnecessary litigation.              
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                             
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                  
the City of St. Louis that we strongly urge           
Governor Jay Nixon to veto HCS/SB 739                 
because the General Assembly does not have            
authority to enact legislation which                  
supersedes the provisions of the Charter with         
respect to the residency of St. Louis City            
firefighters.
