     Mr. Reed moved that Resolution No.          
224 be adopted, at this meeting of the Board.

          Resolution No. 225                     
      WHEREAS, this board is currently           
considering Board Bill # 194 which would         
eliminate smoking in all city owned and city     
leased buildings, including the terminal         
buildings at Lambert-St. Louis International     
Airport; and                                     
     WHEREAS, the airport facility               
currently provides enclosures within the         
terminal building in which smoking is            
permitted. Under the provisions of Board Bill    
#194 these enclosures would be removed; and      
       WHEREAS, for purposes of evaluating       
the benefits of Board Bill #194 it is important  
for this board to obtain as much fact-based      
information regarding the effects of smoking     
as is available; and                             
     WHEREAS , it would be a great               
advantage to our deliberations to know the       
 effect of the second hand smoke being             
 generated by the travelers who make use of        
 the smoking permitted enclosures at the           
 airport; and                                      
       WHEREAS, appropriate testing of the         
 air quality and its effects in the terminal area  
 near these enclosures by the air pollution        
 control division of the City Health               
 Department would provide valuable evidence        
 of potentially dangerous toxins in the airport    
 environment caused by individuals who are         
 smoking tobacco or provide evidence that the      
 smoking permitted enclosures are sufficient       
 and there is no need to include the airport       
 terminal building in the provisions of Board      
 Bill # 194;                                       
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
 the City of St. Louis that we request that the    
 Health Commissioner authorize and direct the      
 air pollution control division to conduct         
 appropriate testing of the air quality and its    
 effects in the terminal building at Lambert-St.   
 Louis International Airport, particularly in the  
 area near the smoking permitted enclosures        
 and to report to this board any findings related  
 to the presence of potentially dangerous toxins   
 in the airport environment caused by              
 individuals who are smoking tobacco.              
 Introduced the 6th day of December, 2002 by:
