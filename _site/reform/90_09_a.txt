           FIRST READING OF                        
             RESOLUTIONS                           
      Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.        
 51 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.     
            Resolution No. 51                      
      Whereas: The City of Saint Louis             
 spends nearly one third of its budget for public  
 safety which includes the St. Louis Police        
 Department, and                                   
      Whereas: The City of St. Louis has not       
 had control over its police department for over   
 100 years, and                                    
      Whereas: The cities of Saint Louis and       
 Kansas City are the only two cities of their      
 category in the nation which do not have local    
 control over their police; and                    
       Whereas: The principles of local control    
 over police are consistent with community         
 policing as espoused by the Saint Louis           
 Metropolitan Police Department and with the       
 basic principles of democratic governance; and    
      Whereas: State control over urban police     
 departments was a mid-nineteenth century          
 reform designed to stop corruption in an era      
 when policing jobs were patronage positions       
 and also historically grew out of he power        
 struggles of a bygone era; and                    
       Whereas: This reform has become             
 outdated with the advent of professional          
 policing principles, standardized training,       
 certification and proper oversight from a         
 variety civilian agencies and structures; and     
       Whereas: State legislators outside of the   
 urban areas, St. Louis in particular, have no     
 constituency concerned with those police          
 departments and are therefore not held            
 accountable for their positions and decisions     
 on these matters and are often unfamiliar with    
 the details of issues involving urban policing;   
 and                                               
       Whereas: Typically, appointed Boards        
 are first accountable to the appointing           
 authority which in this case is the Governor      
 of the State of Missouri and not the citizens     
 of the City of St. Louis and does not seemingly   
 provide enough incentive for such an              
 appointed board to solicit the opinions from      
 Saint Louis citizens and be finally accountable   
 to those citizens as illustrated by recent        
 decisions regarding police residency; and         
      Whereas: Several state legislators have      
 sponsored measures to return control of the       
 St. Louis police department to the citizens of    
 St. Louis;                                        
       Therefore Now Let it Be it resolved that    
 the Saint Louis Board of Aldermen supports        
 the transfer of authority over the Saint Louis    
 Metropolitan Police Department from the           
 State of Missouri to that city's local authorities
 and that such transfer would include all          
 powers to pass laws governing the Saint Louis     
 Metropolitan Police Department in its policing    
 function, with the exception of the governance    
 of police pension funds and the certification     
 of police officers as currently controlled by     
 the State.
