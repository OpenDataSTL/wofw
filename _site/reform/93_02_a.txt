 ("CCHAC") and Missouri Development             
 Finance Board ("MDFB" and together with        
 CCHAC, the "Property Owners"), who are         
 collectively the owners of all the property in 
 the St. Louis Convention Center Hotel          
 Transportation Development District (the       
 "District"), and the "qualified voters" of the 
 District pursuant to the Missouri              
 Transportation Development District Act,       
 Sections 238.200 through 238.280, RSMo.        
 (the "TDD Act"), to hereby submit this         
 Unanimous Verified Petition approving the      
 imposition of a sales tax within the District, 
 as authorized by the Court in its Judgment     
 and Order dated March 15, 2010. In support     
 hereof, the Property Owners state as follows:  
      1. On November 24, 2009, the              
 Property Owners filed a Petition for the       
 Formation of a Transportation Development      
 District with the Circuit Court of the City of 
 St. Louis, Missouri (the "Petition") for       
 establishment of the District.                 
      2. The Petition states that the           
 Property Owners desire to create the District  
for the sole purpose of funding and assisting      
in the funding of a "project" within the           
meaning of Section 238.202.1(5) of the TDD         
Act as generally described in Exhibit C to the     
Petition and incorporated herein by reference      
(the "Transportation Project") through the         
imposition of a transportation development         
district sales tax (the "District Sales Tax")      
pursuant to Section 238.235 of the TDD Act.        
      3. On March 15, 2010, following a            
hearing, the Circuit Court issued its Judgment     
and Order declaring that the District had been     
formed pursuant to the TDD Act, certifying         
the proposed District Sales Tax for qualified      
voter approval, setting the date for a meeting     
of the property owners to elect the Board of       
Directors, and setting a date for the first        
meeting of the District Board of Directors (the    
"Order"). A copy of the Order is attached          
hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein        
by reference.                                      
     4. The Property Owners held a                 
meeting and elected the Board of Directors of      
the District on March 17, 2010.                    
     5. On March 17, 2010, the Board of            
Directors approved Resolution 2010-9, which        
imposed the District Sales Tax, subject to         
approval of the qualified voters in the District.  
      6. The Property Owners are the               
owners of all of the real property within the      
District and are therefore the qualified voters    
for the purpose of voting to impose the            
District Sales Tax pursuant to Section 238.202     
of the TDD Act.                                    
      7. Section 238.216.1(3) of the TDD           
Act provides that if all the owners of property    
in the District joined in the petition for         
formation of the District, such owners may         
cast their ballot by unanimous verified petition   
approving any measure submitted to them as         
voters pursuant to the TDD Act, and each           
owner shall receive one vote per acre owned,       
and thereafter the petition shall be filed with    
the circuit court clerk, which filing shall        
constitute an election under the TDD Act.          
     8. CCHAC owns 1.9752 acres of real            
property within the District and has               
authorized an appropriate official to vote for     
CCHAC in this election.                            
     9. MDFB owns 0.7725 acres of real             
property within the District and has               
authorized an appropriate official to vote for     
MDFB in this election.                             
      10. By this Unanimous Verified               
Petition, the Property Owners, who constitute      
the qualified voters of the District, hereby       
vote in favor of the District Sales Tax.           
     11. Pursuant to the Order, the Circuit        
Court Clerk of the City of St. Louis, Missouri,    
 has been ordered to verify the authenticity of   
 the signatures of the Property Owners on this    
 Unanimous Verified Petition by

      3. The proposed District consists of       
 land on which there are no structures used for  
 permanent or legal residences; accordingly,     
 there are no persons eligible to be registered  
 voters residing within the proposed District.   
      4. The owners of record of the             
 Property constitute the only "qualified         
 voters" for purposes of the Act.                
      5. The Petition is not legally defective   
 and all Respondents have been duly served       
 with process in this action, or otherwise       
 properly appeared in this action.               
       6. No objections to the Petition, timely  
 or otherwise, have been filed.                  
       7. Pursuant to Section 238.212.2 of       
 the Act, the Court held a public hearing on the 
 creation and funding of the proposed District.  
      8. Notice of such public hearing was       
 published once a week for four (4) consecutive  
 weeks in the St. Louis Daily Record as          
 required by Section 238.212 of the Act          
 (publication of said notice occurred on January 
 16, 2010, January 23, 2010, January 30, 2010    
 and February 6, 2010) and said notice was       
 substantially in the form described in Section  
 238.212.1 of the Act.                           
     9. The District is neither illegal nor      
 unconstitutional.                               
      10. The District is composed of            
 contiguous land pursuant to Section 238.207.3   
 of the Act and includes the property legally    
 described in Exhibit A, incorporated herein     
by reference, as depicted on the map attached     
as Exhibit B, incorporated herein by reference.   
     11. The District is properly, duly and       
lawfully organized and is established as a        
political subdivision pursuant to and in          
accordance with the Act for the sole purpose      
of funding the Transportation Project (as         
defined in the Petition).                         
     12. The name of the District is the          
"St. Louis Convention Center Hotel                
Transportation Development District."             
      13. Because the owners of all real          
property in the District filed the Petition, the  
Court hereby certifies the funding method set     
forth in the Petition (i.e., the imposition of a  
sales tax at a rate of not to exceed one percent  
(1.0%) pursuant to Section 238.235 of the         
Act (the "TDD Sales Tax")) for qualified voter    
approval pursuant to Section 238.210.2 of         
the Act upon passage of a resolution calling      
for such funding method by the Board of           
Directors of the District. Upon approval by       
the Board of Directors of the District of such    
resolution, Petitioners may cast their ballot     
and approve the following funding proposal        
by unanimous verified petition:                   
    "Shall the St. Louis Convention Center        
    Hotel Transportation Development              
    District be authorized to impose a            
    transportation development district-wide      
    sales tax at the rate of not to exceed one    
    percent (1.0%) for a period not to exceed     
    thirteen (13) years from the date on which    
    such tax is first imposed for the purpose     
    of funding and assisting in the funding of    
    a parking garage and the operation and        
    maintenance costs of a parking garage         
    located within the boundaries of the          
    District, and for the purpose of funding      
    the operation and administration of the       
    District?                                     
     14. The TDD Sales Tax is neither illegal     
nor unconstitutional and upon approval and        
adoption of a resolution by the Board of          
Directors of the District and submission of a     
unanimous verified petition approving the         
measure stated above by the owners of record      
of the Property pursuant to Section               
238.216.1(3) of the Act, the District may         
impose the TDD Sales Tax.                         
     15. The District is not an undue burden      
on any owner of real property within the          
District and is not unjust or unreasonable.       
      16. The Transportation Project, as          
described in the Petition, is a proper and legal  
project under the Act and will benefit all of     
the real property in the District.                
     17. The Commission has declined to           
consider the Transportation Project.              
       18. The Transportation Project has not      
 been and is not intended to be merged into the    
 state highway and transportation system           
 under the Commission's jurisdiction and is        
 under the jurisdiction of the City. Approval      
 of the Transportation Project therefore shall     
 vest exclusively with the City, subject to the    
 District and the City entering into a mutually    
 satisfactory agreement regarding development      
 and future maintenance of the Transportation      
 Project.                                          
       IT IS HEREBY FURTHER                        
 ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED,
