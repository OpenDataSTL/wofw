Board Member Kennedy introduced by                
request:                                          
           Board Bill No. 397                     
     An ordinance approving a redevelopment       
plan for the 4435-39 Enright Ave. Area            
("Area") after finding that the Area is blighted  
 as defined in Section 99.320 of the Revised       
 Statutes of Missouri, 2000, as amended, (the      
 "Statute" being Sections 99.300 to 99.715         
 inclusive), containing a description of the       
 boundaries of said Area in the City of St. Louis  
 ("City"), attached hereto and incorporated        
 herein as Exhibit "A", finding that               
 redevelopment and rehabilitation of the Area      
 is in the interest of the public health, safety,  
 morals and general welfare of the people of       
 the City; approving the Blighting Study and       
 Plan dated January 15, 2004 for the Area          
 ("Plan"), incorporated herein by attached         
 Exhibit "B", pursuant to Section 99.430;          
 finding that there is a feasible financial plan   
 for the redevelopment of the Area which           
 affords maximum opportunity for                   
 redevelopment of the Area by private              
 enterprise; finding that certain property in the  
 Area may be acquired by the Land Clearance        
 for Redevelopment Authority of the City of        
 St. Louis ("LCRA") through the exercise of        
 eminent domain or otherwise; finding that the     
 property within the Area is unoccupied, but       
 if it should become occupied the Redeveloper      
 shall be responsible for relocating any eligible  
 occupants displaced as a result of                
 implementation of the Plan; finding that          
 financial aid may be necessary to enable the      
 Area to be redeveloped in accordance with
