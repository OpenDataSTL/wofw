       The Board of Police Commissioners

 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and         
 associated Regulations could apply to the      
 service for which bids are being sought herein.
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific  
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform  
work pursuant to a contract executed between       
the successful bidder and the City must be         
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.

     Bidders are also advised that the State       
of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under        
the contract by the contractor or by any           
subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).
