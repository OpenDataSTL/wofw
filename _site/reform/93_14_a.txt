associated City equipment for any solid waste     
that does not originate in Dwelling Units for     
which a Customer pays Solid Waste Services        
Fees; providing that it shall be a violation of   
this Ordinance for any person, business, or

       CONSENT CALENDAR                          
      President Reed introduced Resolutions      
No. 117 through 121 and the Clerk was            
instructed to read same.                         
          Resolution No. 117                     
  2010 Bishop DuBourg High School                
       Cavaliers Baseball Team                   
     WHEREAS, we have been apprised that         
the 2010 Bishop DuBourg High School              
Cavaliers Baseball Team was recently             
crowned the Missouri Class 3 State               
Champions; and                                   
     WHEREAS, Bishop DuBourg (25-4)              
had one district championship, in 1961, and      
no playoff victories to its credit before this   
season. The Cavaliers had just two state titles  
among their boys programs, a basketball          
championship in 1964 and a soccer                
championship they shared with St. Thomas         
Aquinas in 1977; and                             
      WHEREAS, high expectations have been       
penciled onto the things-to-do list for the      
Bishop DuBourg senior class since it first       
stepped onto the baseball diamond in the         
spring of 2007. Last weekend, the 2010           
Bishop DuBourg Cavaliers led by the seniors      
lived up to the hoopla they've shouldered since  
breaking into the program; and                   
     WHEREAS, after surviving a slugfest         
in Friday's semifinals, Bishop DuBourg           
defeated Winfield 8-5 recently in the Class 3    
championship game at Meador Park; and            
      WHEREAS, Cavaliers Coach Joe               
Groaning and his team's contagious hitting       
carried them through the postseason when         
double-figure scoring was the norm in four of    
the last six games.                              
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our       
deliberations to recognize the hard work,        
dedication of the 2010 Bishop DuBourg High       
School Cavaliers Baseball Team and we further    
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy  
of this Resolution across the minutes of these   
 proceedings and to prepare a commemorative       
 copy to the end that it may be presented to      
 our honorees at a time and place deemed          
 appropriate by the Sponsor.

             Officer Adron Long                   
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that         
 Officer Adron Long (DSN 8676), is retiring       
 from the Saint Louis Metropolitan Police         
 Department after 37 years of dedicated           
 service; and                                     
       WHEREAS, in 1973, Officer Long             
 joined the Police Department as a civilian       
 Teleprocessing Clerk and became a Police         
 Cadet in 1974, and then after graduating from    
 the Police Academy in 1975, Officer Long was     
 assigned to Districts 1, 7 and 9, followed by    
 an assignment to the Traffic Safety Division     
 in 1992 and then later became a member of the    
 elite MCSAP Unit (Motor Carrier Safety           
 Assistance Program) in 1998 where he proudly     
 finished his career as a Commercial Vehicle      
 inspector; and                                   
      WHEREAS, for many years, Officer            
 Long consistently performed his duties,          
 keeping our streets safe by reducing the         
 number of commercial motor vehicle accidents     
 through comprehensive inspections of big rigs    
 along the city's high accident corridors; and    
      WHEREAS, Officer Long can be                
 described as a very modest and dedicated         
 Police professional, who for many years has      
 been affectionately known by his colleagues      
 as "Shorty" and is well known for both his       
 tremendous sense of humor and his dedication     
 to commercial vehicle safety; and                
       WHEREAS, Officer Long, while serving       
 the St Louis Metropolitan Police Department,     
 received several awards throughout his           
 distinguished career including a Chief's Letter  
 of Commendation in 1979 and 1983, as well        
 as recognition among fellow law enforcement      
 personnel and the trucking industry as an area   
 expert in the area of commercial motor vehicle   
 safety; and                                      
       WHEREAS, Officer Long's wife, Virga,       
 daughters, Roberta and Raven, son, Adron Jr.,    
 and his many grandchildren can now rest          
 knowing their husband, father and grandfather    
 will no longer have to work long hours and       
 toil for the City of St Louis, and the citizens  
 can be proud that a fine Officer has served      
 them well for the last 37 years.                 
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our       
 deliberations to extend a sincere thanks to       
 Officer Adron Long for his long and productive    
 service to the City of St. Louis and the St.      
 Louis Metropolitan Police Department and          
 we express our best wishes to him for good        
 health and happiness in his well-deserved         
 retirement and we further direct the Clerk of     
 this Board to spread a copy of this Resolution    
 across the minutes of these proceedings and       
 to prepare a commemorative copy to the end        
 that it may be presented to our honoree at a      
 time and place deemed appropriate by the          
 Sponsor.                                          
 Introduced on the 18th day of June, 2010 by:      
 Honorable Donna Baringer,Alderman 16th Ward       
            Resolution No. 119                     
      Lt. Col. William H. Holloman III             
      WHEREAS, we pause in our                     
 deliberations to note the untimely passing of     
 Lt. Col. William H. Holloman III; and             
       WHEREAS, William Holloman, a                
 Tuskegee Airman, didn't stop serving his          
 country when his active duty as one of the        
 United States' first African-American combat      
 pilots ended after World War II. He was called    
 back to service in the Korean War and became      
 the Air Force's first black helicopter pilot. He  
 went to war again in Vietnam; and                 
       WHEREAS, during the nearly four             
 decades after he retired from the Army, he        
 served his country in a different way: by         
 teaching younger generations how war and          
 aviation intersected in a way that helped end     
 centuries of racial separation; and               
       WHEREAS, a St. Louis native who as a        
 teenager was so crazy about flying he would       
 walk two miles to an airport to watch the         
 planes, he volunteered for an all-black aviation- 
 training program at Tuskegee Army Air Field       
 in Alabama. Because some Army generals were       
 dubious about the ability of African Americans    
 to maintain and fly aircraft, the Tuskegee        
 Airmen were required to undergo twice as          
 much training as their white counterparts; and    
      WHEREAS, one of 450 trainees sent to         
 North Africa and Italy, Lt. Col. Holloman flew    
 a single-seat P-51 Mustang fighter-bomber         
 from a base in Italy to targets in Germany,       
 Austria and Eastern European countries. He        
 flew 19 combat missions, including escorting      
 bombers and hitting enemy targets; and            
       WHEREAS, stationed at bases                 
 segregated by race, the black fighter pilots and  
 the white bomber crews mingled in towns           
 where whites insisted on buying drinks for        
 their fighter escorts. When Lt. Col. Holloman     
 sailed back to the States, he walked down a       
 gangplank in New York and saw signs that          
 read, "Whites to the right, coloreds to the left;"
and

 after arrival in the United States; and

 1865, that African Americans in Texas received

 a state observance to be known as the              
 "Independence Day Observance", "Freedom            
 Day" or "Juneteenth Independence Day" for          
 Americans of African descent; and others who

the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and

works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or
