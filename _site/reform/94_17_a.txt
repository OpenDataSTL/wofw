      WHEREAS, we pause in our                      
 deliberations to note the passing of St. Louis

 on August 8, 1918 in Stampley, Mississippi.        
 She was the fifth of six children born to Guy      
 and Claretta White. Her parents, three sisters,    
 and two brothers, all preceded her in death;

 Redeeming Spiritual Church in 1949, which

 leadership of Reverend Hamp Miner. She sang        
 joyously in the No. 2 church choir and served      
 on the Mission Board for many years. Vera          
 drew people from far and near. Her love for        
 God and people motivated her to reach out to       
 the youth of the church. When visiting family,     
 she always brought books for the                   
 grandchildren; and

 an ordained minister on August 25, 1974 under      
 the leadership of Bishop Ozell Robertson. She      
 was an amazing Healer and Prophetess. Her          
 ministry lives on in all the lives she has touched.
 Minister Vera White Blue, "Mother" as she          
 was affectionately called, remained a faithful     
servant and a devoted member for sixty-two        
years and she will never ever be forgotten.

to see her son, State Representative Louis        
Ford, when Missouri Legislature was in            
session; and

            Resolution No. 139                      
              Ronald Isley                          
      WHEREAS, Ronald Isley, born in                
 Cincinnati, Ohio is a very accomplished singer     
 and is known as the lead singer and founding       
 member of the family music group, The Isley        
 Brothers; and                                      
      WHEREAS, born the third of six                
 brothers, Ronald, like many of his siblings,       
 began his career in the church. He began           
 singing at the age of three, winning a $25 war     
 bond for singing at a spiritual contest at the     
 Union Baptist Church. By the age of seven,         
 Ronald was singing onstage at venues such as       
 the Regal Theater in Chicago, alongside Dinah      
 Washington and a few other notables; and           
       WHEREAS, in 1954, when Ronald was            
 only 13, he and his brothers, Rudolph,             
 O'Kelly and Vernon Isley, formed the original      
 lineup of what would become the Isley              
 Brothers. Beginning as a gospel quartet, they      
 began singing alongside their father, O'Kelly,     
 Sr. (also a singer in his own right at the time),  
 and their mother Sallye (the group's first         
 pianist); and                                      
       WHEREAS, Ronald carried on as the            
 leader of the Isleys after Vernon's 1955 death     
 in a bicycle accident at age 13. In 1957, the      
 Isleys moved out of Cincinnati and headed to       
 New York City, where they began recording      
 doo-wop material for several record labels.    
 After several failed attempts, the brothers hit
 pay dirt after cultivating a song that had been
 created after the brothers' inspired           
 performance of Jackie Wilson's "Lonely         
 Teardrops" at a 1959 Washington, D.C. show;    
 and                                            
       WHEREAS, after signing with RCA          
 Records, the group released "Shout", a song    
 that has since become a legendary rock and     
 roll staple; and                               
       WHEREAS, after Kelly Isley's death in    
 1986 and Rudy Isley's exit to fulfill a dream  
 of ministry in 1989, Ronald has carried on     
 with the Isley Brothers name either as a solo  
 artist or with accompanying help from the      
 group's younger brothers, much more            
 prominently, Ernie Isley; and                  
        WHEREAS, in 1990, Ronald scored a       
 top ten duet with Rod Stewart with a cover of  
 his brothers' hit, "This Old Heart of Mine (Is 
 Weak for You)" and in 2003, Ronald recorded    
 a solo album, Here I Am: Bacharach Meets       
 Isley, with Burt Bacharach. In addition, Ronald
 Isley became a sought-after hook singer for    
 hip-hop acts such as R. Kelly, Warren G., 2Pac 
 and UGK. Ronald released his first solo        
 album Mr. I on November 30, 2010. Also in      
 2010, he received a "Legend Award at the Soul  
 Train Music Award; and                         
      WHEREAS, his many fans are looking        
 forward to his performance in Saint Louis on   
 September 17, 2011.                            
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of           
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our     
 deliberations to recognize Ronald Isley and    
 we wish him continued success, achievement     
 and accomplishment and we further direct the

educating deaf children which resulted in the       
St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf. The              
dedication to the purpose displayed by the          
Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet also resulted   
in the St. Joseph Home for Boys, St. Joseph         
Academy and Fontbonne University, all true          
St. Louis regional assets; and

National Register of Historic Buildings; and        
      WHEREAS, today the Sisters continue           
to work closely with lay persons as they serve      
in parishes, schools, colleges, universities and    
diocesan offices; in health care, child care, deaf  
education, youth ministry and adult                 
education-literacy programs; in homes and           
programs for the elderly, in social work,           
neighborhood and community development              
and social concerns; as artists, consultants,       
counselors, and spiritual directors. In a special   
way they are in partnership with men and            
women who are desirous of sharing the mission       
of Jesus. As non-vowed Associates, they meet        
regularly to share life and prayer with one         
another and to share in the Church's mission        
with the Sisters of St. Joseph; and                 
      WHEREAS, the breadth and depth of             
the contributions to the apostolate of the          
Catholic Church in America made by the              
Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, is truly       
amazing.

         EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2011                     
 In accordance with Ordinance No. 65597, the

    1)    Where health benefits as defined in        
          the Ordinance are provided to the          
          employee, the living wage rate is          
          $11.58 per hour (130% of the federal       
          poverty level income guideline for a       
          family of three); and                      
    2)    Where health benefits as defined in

 Ordinance and these rates are effective as of       
 April 1, 2011. These rates will be further
