       WHEREAS, during the tragic days of           
 July 1 - 3, 1917 East St. Louis erupted into       
 one of this nation's worst racial conflicts when   
 African - American workers were attacked           
 out of fear of them acquiring jobs at the major    
 steel mill in the metro east area; and             
      WHEREAS, for three days in July of            
 1917 East Louis was ablaze with racial anger       
 and prejudice that displaced more than 1,200       
 African - American families, leaving over          
 6,000 people homeless, hundreds wounded            
 and dead as the African - American section of

 the NAACP organized a silent                       
 commemorative march in New York City               
 where over 10,000 people participated to draw      
 national attention to the then regular lynching    
 of African - American men and particularly         
 the plight of those African - American             
 individuals killed in the East St. Louis riot and  
 those families now homeless in St. Louis area;     
 and                                                
      WHEREAS, in direct response to the            
 East St. Louis Riot and picking up the spirit      
 from the silent march held in New York City        
 concerned citizens in the St. Louis area formed    
 a St. Louis chapter of the Urban League            
 organized to provide aid to surviving families     
 and to locally promote the National Urban          
 League mission in New York City of                 
 advocating and working for the ending of           
 violence against African - Americans and to       
 promote equality for all people in America;       
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, the processional to be held        
 this July 3, 2004 will also be an attempt to      
 reenact the historical march held in New York     
 City in 1917 that brought national attention      
 to this tragedy and to promoted and highlight     
 the need for equality and justice for all which   
 are tenets upon which America was founded         
 and July Fourth activities are designed to        
 celebrate; and                                    
       WHEREAS, many surviving families            
 from the rioting reestablished themselves in      
 St. Louis City with a great number relocating     
 to then privately owned land called Kinloch,      
 Missouri helping to establish the City of         
 Kinloch thus expanding and further developing     
 St. Louis County illustrating just a little of    
 the regional impact of this riot; and             
       WHEREAS, little is said of this major       
 event in the history of this country that         
 spawned several local organizations, expanded     
 and caused the creation of new cities in our      
 area; and                                         
       WHEREAS, a great number of the              
 survivors and the descendants of the survivors    
 of this riot still reside in the City of St. Louis
 and the surrounding municipalities                
 contributing to the fabric of the life in this    
 metro area;
