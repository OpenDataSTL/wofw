       Senator Claire McCaskill                  
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that        
 Senator Claire McCaskill will be receiving the  
 Government Award from the St. Louis             
 Community Empowerment Foundation; and           
      WHEREAS, Claire McCaskill is a 4th         
generation Missourian who has spent her           
entire life in the Show-Me State. Born in         
Rolla and raised in Lebanon and Columbia,         
Claire has never forgotten her roots; and         
      WHEREAS, after another move, Claire         
attended Hickman High School in Columbia,         
while her father served as a state insurance      
commissioner and her mother became                
Columbia's first woman city council member.       
At Hickman High School, Claire graduated near     
the top of her class and was deeply involved      
in student activities, while also working in a    
fabric store since she sewed many of her own      
clothes; and                                      
     WHEREAS, Claire worked her way               
through college and law school at the             
University of Missouri in Columbia. Claire        
clerked for the Missouri Court of Appeals in      
Kansas City and then got a job as an assistant    
prosecutor in Kansas City, where she was a        
felony trial prosecutor handling sex crimes,      
homicides, and specializing in arson cases. In    
1982, McCaskill won a seat in the State           
Legislature. She juggled the responsibilities     
of both mother and legislator and was the first   
woman to ever give birth while she was an         
active member of the Missouri Legislature;        
and                                               
      WHEREAS, Claire broke new ground            
again in 1993 when she became the first female    
Jackson County Prosecutor, which included         
Kansas City. This was the largest prosecutor's    
office in the state and she began many new        
programs, including a domestic violence unit      
and one of the nation's first Drug Courts. She    
held this position until she was sworn in as      
Missouri Auditor in 1999; and                     
     WHEREAS, as State Auditor, Claire has        
been credited for revolutionizing the office and  
making it into a true watchdog for taxpayers      
and citizens. In 2004, Claire took on her own     
party establishment and became the first          
person to ever defeat a sitting Missouri          
governor in a primary election; and               
      WHEREAS, in November of 2006,               
Claire became the first woman elected to the      
United States Senate from Missouri, vowing        
to bring Harry Truman's no-nonsense style         
of accountability back to Washington. It only     
seemed fitting that her place in the Senate       
chamber is a desk shared by none other than       
Senator Truman himself.                           
      WHEREAS, after a busy week in               
Washington, Claire returns home to St. Louis      
to a full house. After seven years a single       
mom, Claire married Joseph Shepard, a St.         
Louis businessman, in April 2002. They each       
brought children to the marriage, which created   
a blended family of nine: Benjamin, 32, Carl,     
30, Marilyn, 28, Michael, 25, Austin, 20,         
Maddie, 19 and Lily, 16. Claire's 79-year old     
 mother Betty Anne lives with the family and        
 continues to join her on trips around Missouri.    
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

            Denise Thimes                        
     WHEREAS, we have been apprised that         
 Denise Thimes will be receiving the             
 Entertainment Award from the St. Louis          
 Community Empowerment Foundation; and           
       WHEREAS, an accomplished perform-         
 er, Denise Thimes has always been destined      
 for stardom. While many artists "dabble" in     
 theater, Denise Times is an undisputed class    
 act. She has toured both America and Europe     
 with several critically acclaimed productions   
 and is an 8-time recipient of the St. Louis     
 Black Repertory Woodie Award for both           
 musicals and drama; and

 unique artist is often asked by fellow          
 noteworthy musicians "Why haven't we            
 heard of you?" Not to worry. With a voice       
 that "ranks with one of the greats," it won't   
 be long. It's clear that Denise Thimes is       
 unquestionably one of the fastest rising stars  
 in modern jazz. So much, in fact, that when     
 Queen Elizabeth II made her highly publicized   
 visit to the United States in May of 2007, she  
 hand-selected Denise as the entertainment for   
 her private dinner gala with President George   
 W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush among         
 many other esteemed guests; and                 
       WHEREAS, whether headlining at the        
 historic "Blue Note Jazz Club" in New York,     
 conquering the national jazz festival scene, or 
 sharing the stage with the legendary Tony       
 Bennett, Denise Thimes has an unmistakable      
 tendency to steal the show and astonish         
 crowds of every size and background; and        
       WHEREAS, a graduate of Spelman            
 College and an honorary member of the Sigma     
 Gamma Rho Sorority Inc., Denise Thimes lists    
 her biggest influences as Marlena Shaw,         
 Carmen McCrae, and her parents, the late        
 Mildred Thimes and St. Louis radio              
 personality Lou "Fatha" Thimes. When she        
 is not wowing audiences with her talent, style  
 and poise, she resides in St. Louis with her    
 son and daughter; and                           
      WHEREAS, in a career that spans over         
two decades, Denise has truly been one of the      
most cherished voices of modern jazz. With a       
number of distinguished gigs across the            
country and overseas already lined up, the         
rising first lady of jazz is unquestionably on     
the brink of certain stardom. As jazz              
aficionado Phoebe Jacobs stated following          
another famed New York show, "Denise               
Thimes is like Ella and Sarah born all over        
again."                                            
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our         
deliberations to recognize Denise Thimes and       
we wish her continued success, achievement         
and accomplishment and we further direct the       
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this       
Resolution across the minutes of these             
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative         
copy to the end that it may be presented to        
our honorees at a time and place deemed            
appropriate by the Sponsor.

             RESOLUTIONS                           
      Ms. Triplett introduced Resolution No.       
 10 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.     
            Resolution No. 10                      
  Cleanup of the West Lake Landfill                
       WHEREAS, 66 years ago, the United           
 States government began processing uranium        
 for the development of nuclear weapons at         
 the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (MCW),            
 near Downtown St. Louis. From 1946 until          
 1957 the radioactive wastes were trucked to a     
 23-acre tract at the St. Louis Airport on Brown   
 Road (now McDonnell Blvd.) on the banks           
 of Coldwater Creek, and were dumped there;        
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, some of those wastes were          
 later trucked to Latty Avenue in Hazelwood        
 for drying and shipping to Colorado for           
 reprocessing, with dispersal resulting along      
 the haul roads; and                               
      WHEREAS, in 1973 some of the Latty           
 Avenue wastes were illegally dumped at the       
 West Lake Municipal Waste Landfill in            
 Bridgeton, next to Earth City, in the Missouri   
 River floodplain; and                            
      WHEREAS, in 1997 Congress                   
 transferred responsibility from the U.S.         
 Department of Energy to the U.S. Army Corps      
 of Engineers for the remediation of the nation's 
 abandoned sites where work had been              
 performed for the early atomic weapons           
 program; and                                     
       WHEREAS, the Corps has been                
 directing the cleanup of all the sites containing
 MCW radioactive wastes in St. Louis City         
 and County, under the Formerly Utilized Sites    
 Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), except         
 for the West Lake Landfill, and expects to       
 continue employing its trained contractors and   
 personnel in St. Louis for an additional four    
 to five years; and                               
       WHEREAS, because the U.S.                  
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had        
 placed West Lake on its Superfund National       
 Priorities List in 1990, it therefore had assumed
 responsibility for the landfill's wastes and     
 remediation; and                                 
       WHEREAS, the EPA issued a Record           
 of Decision in May 2008 about West Lake,         
 dictating that the radioactive wastes were to    
 remain in the landfill, with merely a cover of   
 rocks, construction rubble, and clay, and no     
 liner below to protect the wastes from           
 groundwater leaching; and                        
       WHEREAS, residents in St. Louis            
 County north of I-70 and most St. Louis City     
 residents drink water from the Missouri River,   
 downstream from West Lake.                       
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we request that       
 Congress transfer jurisdiction over the cleanup  
 of West Lake radioactive wastes (Operable        
 Unit One) from the EPA Superfund Program         
 to the Corps of Engineers' FUSRAP and that       
 those wastes be excavated and shipped to a       
 licensed radioactive waste disposal site.        
 Furthermore, the Board of Aldermen of the        
 City of St. Louis urges all those involved in    
 the cleanup of the West Lake radioactive         
 wastes to ensure that these wastes no longer     
 migrate into the human environment, to the       
 detriment of today's and future generations.

 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage

Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.
