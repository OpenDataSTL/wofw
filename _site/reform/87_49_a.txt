The Board of Public Service at its meeting on   
March 1, 2005 held a hearing to determine       
whether the conditional use permit issued for   
Advance Auto Parts, 6216 Morganford should      
be revoked.                                     
          FINDINGS OF FACTS                     
      1. A conditional use permit was issued    
for the property on October 7, 1997 with 13     
conditions. The permit number is 102480.        
     2. On or about March 31, 1999, the         
conditional use permit, with the same           
conditions, was transferred to Advance Auto     
Parts.                                          
     3.   Complaints were received by the       
 alderman and the city concerning possible         
 violations of the conditions issued with the      
 conditional use permit.                           
       4. Advance Auto Parts was notified          
 of the hearing of March 1, 2005 that testimony    
 would be taken to determine if there were         
 violations of the conditional use permit.         
       5. A return receipt signed by Advance       
 Auto Parts was returned to this Board's           
 Secretary showing that a letter of notice of      
 hearing was received by Advance on February       
 1 6, 2005.                                        
      6. The premises were also posted with        
 notices of the hearing.                           
      7. Advance Auto Parts was not                
 represented at the hearing.                       
      8. The Board finds that the following        
 violations of the conditions occurred on          
 numerous occasions:                               
      Car repairs were performed on the lot.       
      There were no signs posted on the            
 premises notifying customers that car repairs     
 are not allowed on the premises.                  
       Trash was not picked up continuously        
 and there was trash on the ground outside the     
 store on the parking lot.                         
       The business was open after 6:00 p.m.       
 on Sundays and business was in fact being         
 conducted after 6:00 p.m. The Zoning              
 Administrator purchased items after 6:00 p.m.     
 The business posted signs indicating that the     
 store was open until 9:00 p.m. on Sundays.        
        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW                         
       The Board finds that the imposed            
 conditions of the conditional use permit have     
 been violated and the conditional use permit
