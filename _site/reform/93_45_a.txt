              Kyle Dubbert                         
      WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert came to work           
for the City of St. Louis Board of Election        
Commissioners in June 2006, at a time when         
the Board was involved in a complex                
technological overhaul of voting equipment,        
namely transitioning from the punch card           
voting system to optical scan and touch screen     
voting technology; and                             
      WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert was one of             
a bi-partisan team assigned to mastering the       
hardware and software that supported the           
optical scan and touch screen voting               
technology, tasked with developing the             
infrastructure, programming, and networking        
required to administer a city wide election;       
and                                                
     WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert assisted in             
developing testing protocol for the electronic     
voting equipment that adhered to state and         
federal regulations and guidelines; and            
      WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert was one of             
a bi-partisan team which recruited and trained     
over 250 technical specialists, a new type of      
poll worker developed by the Board of Election     
Commissioners, whose duties were to set up,        
troubleshoot, and shut down the electronic         
voting equipment at each of the City's 120         
polling places; and                                
      WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert exhibited              
such a knowledge and quick understanding of        
the electronic voting equipment though self        
study and advanced networking courses that         
the Board of Election Commissioners was able       
to administer its own elections without the        
help of outside consultants and vendors as         
early as November 2006, while other                
jurisdictions continue to utilize outside          
consulting corporations to administer              
elections; and                                     
      WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert played a               
major part in the smooth administration of at      
least nine city-wide elections and two special     
elections in his nearly five years at the Board    
of Election Commissioners, efforts which           
allowed the Board of Election Commissioners        
to consistently release election results quicker,  
more accurately, and more efficiently than         
other election authorities in the Metro area;      
and                                                
      WHEREAS, Kyle Dubbert's outgoing             
personality and loyalty was well balanced by       
his irreverent sense of humor and made the         
Board of Election Commissioners an engaging        
workplace.                                         
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 of Hope" which was performed and well               
 embraced at the world's Famous Staple Center        
 in Los Angeles and they will be releasing the       
 acclaimed music video in July 2011; and
