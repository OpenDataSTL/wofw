     The Rotary Club of St. Louis                   
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that           
 the Rotary Club of St. Louis is celebrating its    
 100th Anniversary of service to the St. Louis      
 region; and                                        
       WHEREAS, on February 22, 1910 a              
 group of St. Louis businessmen gathered at         
 Lippe's Cafe on Eighth Street in downtown          
 to hold the first meeting of the Rotary Club of    
 St. Louis; and                                     
      WHEREAS, Rotary Clubs are actively            
 providing humanitarian aid to people in need       
 in their local communities and in villages         
 around the globe. The early excitement of the      
 Rotary movement inspired Club 11 to sponsor        
 17 new clubs throughout Missouri and as far        
 away as Lincoln, Nebraska and Hobart,              
 Oklahoma from 1918 to 1941; and                    
       WHEREAS, Club 11 Rotarians are               
 special people working together to improve         
 the human condition and enjoying fellowship        
 along the way. Individually they can do little     
 to address human needs, but as a group they        
 inspire each other to do wonderful things; and     
       WHEREAS, a truly remarkable tradition        
 spanned from 1963 to 1978. Club 11

 YMCA 16 "Youth Mobiles," full-sized vans           
 equipped with athletic equipment to support        
 their youth programs; and                          
       WHEREAS, perhaps their most                  
 prestigious service event today is their annual    
 Eighth Grade Awards Program, which has been        
 ongoing since 1984. An exceptional eighth          
 grade student is selected from each of the city's  
 public and private grade schools. A Rotarian       
 visits the graduating assembly at each school,     
 the winner is announced and the award              
 presented. In recent years, the award has          
 included, among other gifts, a weekend outing      
 at Skyway Farm and a generous $20,000              
 scholarship offer from Webster University.         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

              Linda Williams                           
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that              
 Linda Williams will be receiving an award from        
 Grace Hill and her name will be placed on the         
 Wall of Fame of the Grace Hill Women's                
 Business Center; and                                  
       WHEREAS, Linda Williams has lived               
 all her life in St. Louis except for an 8-year        
 stay in New Jersey. She attended Florissant           
 Valley Community College, taking business             
 courses and later on added some child care            
 classes as well. After she returned to                
 Florissant she worked for AT&T for three              
 years. She got the entrepreneurial spirit while       
 working for others and was looking to start           
 her own business. She noticed that many               
 people needed reliable child care in order to be      
 able to work; and                                     
      WHEREAS, her first connection with               
 Grace Hill and the Women's Business Center            
 was working with real estate executive Marvin         
 Steele (Lynn Steele' brother) to find a building      
 to makeover into a day care center. They              
 found a building that she had gutted and         
 redesigned. Although delayed by the City of      
 Florissant, she opened her center in September   
 of 2004; and                                     
        WHEREAS, Bright Beginnings Daycare        
 is licensed to serve 85 children, originally from
 six weeks to 12 years of age but she has since   
 cut back to six weeks to 11 years. The center    
 operates day and night. Linda is fortunate       
 that her highly qualified sister supervises the  
 night operations. She has 21 other employees,    
 all of whom either have their associate degrees  
 in Early Childhood Education or are currently    
 studying for the degree. Bright Beginnings       
 operates seven classrooms and has been           
 continuously filled with a waiting list until    
 late last year, when many people lost their      
 jobs and had to pull their children out; and     
       WHEREAS, Marvin Steele introduced          
 Linda to the WBC where she worked with           
 Kristi Kight on completing her business          
 development plan and took business classes.      
 She completed the Business Development           
 course before opening her center. The WBC        
 encouraged her to apply for a $25,000 ARCHS      
 (Area resources for Community and Human          
 Services) grant which she received. "They        
 worked with me throughout the process and        
 also helped me apply for and get an additional   
 loan of $3500 to get started." She has continued 
 consulting with Lynn and others at the WBC       
 periodically.                                    
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 her outstanding achievement and we further

               Denise Belue                       
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that         
 Denise Belue will be receiving an award from     
 Grace Hill and her name will be placed on the    
 Wall of Fame of the Grace Hill Women's           
 Business Center; and                             
      WHEREAS, Denise Belue is a local St.        
 Louisan who received her Bachelors of            
 Business Administration (BSBA) degree at         
 Lindenwood College and a Masters of Social       
 Work (MSW) from the George Warren Brown          
 School of Social Work at Washington              
 University. She has been married for 35 years    
and has a son and a daughter; and                 
      WHEREAS, "After college my first jobs       
were in foster care and mental health. I always   
wanted to work directly with children and         
their families so that whenever possible they     
could be reunited. Since 1998 I have had the      
goal which evolved into `Child Quest'" she        
said. She wanted to work directly with children   
and parents needing counseling, and to offer      
the service to working parents. "In October I     
will have been in business six years," she said.  
"We serve 40 children, 16 of them infants and     
toddlers, with daycare and help for the whole     
family to minimize stresses in their              
relationships." Denise felt most successful       
when the parent of a child who had left that      
year to enter public kindergarten, stopped in     
to see her for more counseling. "I was so         
happy that she felt free to come in even after    
her child had moved on," she said; and

teachers and an aide and is housed in a one-

business, in that for the first time they now

In 2003 or 2004 having applied for the grant,     
she took business training courses with the

      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

Introduced on the 12th day of March, 2010

HonorableApril Ford-Griffin,Alderwoman 5th Ward   
          Resolution No. 377                      
             Emma Forrest                         
     WHEREAS, we have been apprised that          
Emma Forrest will be receiving an award from      
Grace Hill and her name will be placed on the     
Wall of Fame of the Grace Hill Women's            
 Business Center; and                              
       WHEREAS, Emma Forrest was born              
 and raised in St. Louis. She is married and has   
 four children, two of whom are still at home.     
 She took business classes at Sawyers Business     
 College. After taking classes she worked for      
 A.G. Edwards and Boatmen's Bank (now              
 Bank of America) working in security and          
 MacDonnell-Douglas, engineering support on        
 the F-15 for 7 years. When MacDonnell-            
 Douglas started layoffs, she had just given       
 birth to her youngest son and realized that       
 she needed to be thinking about how to make       
 money and take care of her baby at the same       
 time. So "New U Infant & Child Care" was          
 born in her home, and she began her               
 relationship with Grace Hill; and                 
       WHEREAS, she ran her day care,              
 starting in one bedroom of her house and          
 slowly growing. Through the Women's               
 Business Center she completed a business          
 plan, applied for an ARCHS (Area Resources        
 for Community and Human Services) grant as        
 well as a small loan from the Women's             
 Business Center. "None of this even               
 happened, however," she said. "I did              
 everything on my own when I could get the         
 money together;" and                              
       WHEREAS, when new building for              
 moderate income began in neighborhoods of         
 mid-town St. Louis, the family decided to buy     
 and move back to the city. Emma went into         
 real estate sales successfully, until a market    
 crash. Then she began preparing tax returns       
 for Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. She was the       
 manager of a south side office on Jefferson       
 Avenue when she became aware that there           
 was no place to get anything to eat in the        
 neighborhood. She had to drive to get a snack     
 and people without cars living in that area had   
 to take a bus to shop; and                        
       WHEREAS, she found a vacant                 
 storefront near the tax office and rented it.     
 She knew the neighborhood could use a             
 convenience store but did not realize then that   
 the area also had many senior citizens'           
 apartments. These people immediately came         
 through the door she really filled a need in the  
 neighborhood. M & M Market is open six            
 days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Emma            
 worked on a business plan with the help and       
 advice from the WBC and she took all the          
 classes she could on running a business.          
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 (Northern Ireland) unit in the 1920s; and

     Resolution in Support of The                
    Uniting American Families Act                
       WHEREAS, A driving goal under U.S.        
 immigration law is family unification and the   
 ability of families and individuals to reside   
 legally in the U.S., engaging fully in our      
 country's rich civil traditions and form of     
 government; and,                                
      WHEREAS, The City of St. Louis             
celebrates and respects all immigrant groups      
and all families, including those of same-sex     
gay and lesbian partners; and,                    
     WHEREAS, Current U.S. immigration            
law discriminates against a U.S. citizen or       
lawful permanent resident and his or her          
foreign-born partner by not allowing the          
sponsorship of the foreign partner for            
immigration benefits, although an opposite-       
sex couple would have the right to do so; and,    
     WHEREAS, This form of discrimination         
and unfair treatment under the law has            
devastating and life-altering consequences for    
same-sex partners; and,                           
      WHEREAS, The inability to sponsor a         
same-sex partner leaves the couple with the       
following limited options: 1. Choose to remain    
in a costly long-distance international           
relationship; 2. Choose to live abroad in the     
foreign partner's country, if allowable; 3. Seek  
a visa, independent of the partnership, for the   
foreign-born partner, creating a                  
limited duration of legal stay; 4. Choose to      
allow the foreign-born partner to remain          
undocumented or allow a visa to lapse, creating   
daily uncertainty and fear of deportation; or,    
5. Terminate the relationship; and,               
      WHEREAS, The limited legal options          
for same-sex partners to keep their               
relationship unified exacts an enormous           
emotional, financial, and mental toll,            
disproportionate to opposite-sex couples in       
bi-national relationships; and,                   
      WHEREAS, Beyond the personal                
challenges to same-sex couples, the City of       
St. Louis and the entire country risk a great     
loss of talent should the foreign partner and/    
or the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent           
resident be forced to depart the U.S. to keep     
the relationship whole in another country;        
and,                                              
      WHEREAS, Currently pending in the           
United States Congress is the Uniting             
American Families Act (H.R. 1024/5.424),          
reintroduced on February 12,2009, by              
Representative Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and          
Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT). The purpose         
of this bill is "to amend the Immigration and     
Nationality Act to eliminate discrimination in    
the immigration laws by permitting permanent      
partners of United States citizens and lawful     
permanent residents to obtain lawful              
permanent resident status in the same manner      
as spouses of citizens and lawful permanent       
residents and to penalize immigration fraud in    
connection with permanent partnerships";          
and,                                              
   WHEREAS, The Uniting American                  
Families Act would allow same-sex                 
 relationships to be treated no differently from       
 opposite sex relationships and all legal              
 requirements of qualifying under the statute          
 and proving the good faith nature of their            
 relationship would remain; and,                       
      WHEREAS, The Uniting American                    
 Families Act would bring U.S. immigration             
 law in line with the 19 other countries that          
 already recognize same sex partnerships for           
 immigration purposes: Australia, Belgium,             
 Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,             
 Germany, Iceland, Israel, the Netherlands,            
 New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa,          
 Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United            
 Kingdom; and,                                         
       WHEREAS, The City of St. Louis fully            
 supports the measures of Congress to allow            
 gay and lesbian partners to access immigration        
 benefits in an equal and fair manner, equivalent      
 to opposite sex partners who currently enjoy          
 such legal rights;                                    
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                             
 RESOLVED that we, the members of the City             
 of St. Louis Board of Aldermen, do hereby             
 express our strong support for the passage of         
 the Uniting American Families Act, or other           
 laws that will end discrimination for bi-national     
 same-sex partners under the immigration laws          
 and will allow gay and lesbian residents of the       
 City of St. Louis fair and equal access to            
 immigration benefits through their permanent          
 partnerships.                                         
      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED That
