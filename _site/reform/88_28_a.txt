to reject any and all bids. The Board also        
reserves the right to consider criteria other     
than the low bid in the award of a contract.      
Among other factors, the Board will consider      
the location of the business, minority interest

submitted in relation to the needs of the         
St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.         
      Bidders are hereby advised that the St.     
Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and            
associated Regulations could apply to the         
service for which bids are being sought herein.   
This Ordinance requires that, unless specific     
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform     
work pursuant to a contract executed between      
the successful bidder and the City must be        
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage      
rates and if rates are adjusted during term of    
the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,           
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.   
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage          
Acknowledgment            and     Acceptance      
Declaration" with the bid. Failure to submit      
this Declaration with the bid will result in      
rejection of the bid. A successful bidder's       
failure to comply with the contract provisions    
related to the Living Wage Ordinance may          
result in termination of the contract and the     
imposition of additional penalties as set for in  
the Ordinance and Regulations.                    
      Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations
