 children, all except one sister are deceased;    
 and                                              
      WHEREAS, in the early 1950's George         
 moved to St. Louis to become an educator.        
 George was the first and only child in his       
 family to graduate from high school. George      
 wanted to attend Lincoln University, but         
 moved to St. Louis; and                          
       WHEREAS, in St. Louis he got a job at      
 a glue factory. He worked there for a short

 Merial Johnson. In 1952, they married and in     
 the same year, George was drafted into the       
 United States Army where he served two years     
 in the Korean War; and                           
        WHEREAS, after serving in the military,   
 George moved back home to his wife and their     
 first child Valerie JoAnne was born. In 1954,    
 George began his career at Monsanto              
 Company where he worked for over 33 years,       
 not to mention, he worked several part-time      
 jobs to make ends meet for his family. In        
 1954, his second oldest child Tamara Denise      
 was born. In 1958, he finally got a son,         
 Richard Garcia. Also in that year, George        
 started his part-time job at The Church of the   
Good Shepard in Town & Country, Missouri           
where he worked part-time for over 34 years.

full-time job and two part-time jobs until         
retiring at Monsanto Company in 1985.              
George was a dedicated hard worker. He did         
what it took to take care of his family. In fact,  
George worked tirelessly at the Church of the      
Good Shepard until he had a stroke in 2005.        
From 2000-2005 George worked hard taking           
care of his wife Ruth as her health began failing  
her. In 2005, Ruth, who had Multiple Sclerosis     
had to have triple by-pass surgery. George         
provided the best care possible for his wife       
until her death in 2005; and                       
     WHEREAS, while working several jobs,          
George still found time to interact with his       
children by picking them and their friends up      
to go to and from various extracurricular          
activities before and after school. He has         
always opened his home up to family and            
friends. He has helped raise many children         
and grand children; and                            
      WHEREAS, during all of this, George          
served his community as well by attending          
several block unit and neighborhood                
association meetings. Also, he was the Captain     
for Night Out on his street, Drury Lane in         
which that year, they won! He worked               
tirelessly in efforts like Operation Brightside    
to keep the neighborhood clean. Not to             
mention, he was a member of the Urban League.      
George loved helping people. He would give         
money to neighbors in need. While taking           
care of his sick wife, he also looked after his    
older sisters Mable and Francis. He would          
assist his sister Mable with her yard work,        
take her to meetings and drive her where she       
needed to go until she was unable to drive         
herself; and                                       
       WHEREAS, in the early 80's George           
joined the New Northside Missionary Baptist        
Church under the leadership of Emeritus            
Pastor, Bishop W. J. Ellis, Jr., where he worked   
in the Berean District with the Laymen. In         
addition to serving on the Deacon board,           
George loved to sing, he was a member of the       
New Northside Male Chorus and one of the           
first members of the Willie J. Ellis, Jr. morning  
Gospel Choir. George still finds time to come      
to church.

works projects to be paid prevailing wages.
