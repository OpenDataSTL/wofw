 when they moved to Saint Louis, they              
 remained dirt poor. It was after graduating       
 from Sumner High School when Joe began his        
 journey towards greener pastures by enlisting     
 in the Navy; and                                  
      WHEREAS, in October of 1959, while           
 trying to muster up funds for his family, Mr.     
 Robinson made a pitch to a man named George       
 Speer, who was the branch manager at the old      
 Northwest Bank, and also a Naval Reservist.       
 Speer saw a spark in this young and eager         
 teen, and drove him to the nearest Navy           
 recruiter; and                                    
       WHEREAS, Like most African                  
 Americans of this era, Joe heard terrible things  
 about the Navy, including the notion that         
 black sailors could only attain the most menial   
 jobs. This daunting idea did not sway him         
 from the Navy's appeal. He went on to serve       
 over eight years of active duty on sea and        
 shore duty, however he met a defeating            
 challenge when the Navy denied him                
 acceptance to flight school; and                  
        WHEREAS, he kept his head up and           
 kept his hand in service nonetheless after the    
 rejection by leaving active duty and joining      
 the Saint Louis Metropolitan Police               
 Department. Here he found a niche, and            
 successfully moved up in the ranks. For 29        
 years Robinson cleaned up the streets of Saint    
 Louis, retiring in 1997 as a lieutenant. All the  
 while, he never broke his service with the        
 Navy as he continued his affiliation with the     
 Naval Reserve, earning an officer's commission    
 as a lieutenant junior grade. More promotions     
 would then follow as he was promoted to           
 lieutenant commander in 1994; and                 
       WHEREAS, in addition to the militancy       
 and discipline he has demonstrated as a citizen   
 of our country, he learned to fly. Joe Robinson   
 owns a commercial pilots license, he has flown    
 12 logged hours in the Boeing 707 and in July     
 2012 Joe will celebrate 50 years of continuous    
 flying; and                                       
       WHEREAS, Joe and his wife Carmalita,        
 are the owners of a Piper Cherokee Aircraft       
 that they hangar at the St Louis Downtown         
 Airport in Cahokia, Illinois. In addition to these
 astounding accomplishments, Joe is a member       
 of the CSO staff at the Thomas F. Eagleton        
 Federal Court Building; and                       
    WHEREAS, Mr. Robinson is an active             
 member in many civic organizations including      
the Tuskegee Airmen, Incorporated, Hugh J.        
White Chapter, Saint Louis. As many know,         
the Tuskegee Airmen consisted of pilots,          
navigators, bombardiers, maintenance and          
support staff, and instructors, all of whom       
contributed to the fight of segregation and       
prejudice to become one of the most highly        
respect fighter groups of World War II.           
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT
