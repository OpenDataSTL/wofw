Honorable Frank Williamson,Alderman 26th Ward     
          Resolution No. 112                      
     WHEREAS, we pause in our                     
deliberations to note the passing of lifelong     
St. Louis resident, Rochelle "Roki" Lenore        
Patterson; and                                    
      WHEREAS, Rochelle Lenore Patterson          
was born in St. Louis, Missouri at the historic   
Homer G. Phillips Hospital on August 17,          
1953. She was the first born child of Cornelia    
and Oscar Patterson who preceded her in           
passing. Rochelle accepted Christ at an early     
age at Star Bethel Missionary Baptist Church      
in the company of her doting grandparents,        
mother and aunt. She attended the St. Louis       
Public Schools where she was an excellent and     
popular student; graduating from Roosevelt        
High School in June 1971; and                     
      WHEREAS, Rochelle, or "Roki" as she         
endearingly came to be known by all, set out      
for Atlanta, Georgia where she attended           
Spelman College and earned a B.A. in Theatre      
Production. She was a talented performer who      
loved music, dance, writing and singing. Being    
a creative and charismatic soul, she enjoyed      
rubbing elbows with fellow entertainers and       
often reminisced of the days when she "hung       
out" with the likes of Parliament, The            
Funkadelics and future celebrities like Samuel    
L. Jackson, to name a few. After giving birth     
to her son Alex, Roki settled in St. Louis where  
she remained until the present; and               
      WHEREAS, Roki loved the theater and         
worked tirelessly with various production         
companies while simultaneously pursuing a         
career in social services; beginning with the     
Missouri Division of Family Services where        
she worked for over 13 years. To Roki, theater    
and social services made a perfect match and      
she usually found ways to merge the two to        
serve the greater good of the community. She      
excelled, however, in the theater, where her      
gift for lighting design and technical direction  
kept her in high demand by such notable           
theater companies as the St. Louis Black          
 Repertory Co. & Liberty Playhouse, where         
 she served as Technical Director for nearly 10   
 years; and                                       
       WHEREAS, She will always be                
 remembered as an advocate for the                
 disadvantaged. After losing many loved ones      
 to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980's, Roki     
 embarked upon her own personal crusade to        
 promote AIDS awareness and education;            
 working for St. Louis Effort For AIDS (EFA)      
 and Doorways and creating lasting programs       
 to benefit those struggling to live with that    
 dreadful disease; and                            
      WHEREAS, Roki loved the Lord and            
 always incorporated "church work" into her       
 adult life. She was an active member of St.      
 Stephen's Episcopal Church and also              
 fellowshipped with many other churches over      
 the years as she collaborated on various         
 community projects she was involved in. In       
 recent years, Roki shifted her focus to helping  
 the homeless and unemployed while working        
 at Immanuel Lutheran Church; and                 
      WHEREAS, Roki went home to be with          
 the Lord on Tuesday, June 10, 2008. She is       
 survived by her son: Alexander M. Patterson      
 of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, grandsons:          
 Trevion and DeOnte, life-partner: Charles        
 (Anthony) Harmon, brother: Michael L.            
 Patterson of Dallas, Texas, aunt: Augusta        
 Harvey, of Atlanta, Georgia, cousins: Angela     
 Harvey of Vancouver, B.C. Canada, Barbara        
 Harvey of Atlanta, Georgia and Deborah           
 Patterson of St. Louis. Roki will truly be       
 missed by all of her relatives as well as an     
 extraordinary host of friends who are her        
 extended family.                                 
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to           
 remember the many contributions of Rochelle      
 "Roki" Lenore Patterson to the citizens of       
 the City of St. Louis and we join with her       
 many friends in expressing our sorrow at her     
 passing, and we further direct the Clerk of

             RESOLUTIONS

 113 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.  
            Resolution No. 113                   
      WHEREAS, the price of gas has reached      
up to $4.00 a gallon and is expected to continue    
to rise, placing a hardship on both residents       
and mass transit operators, as such mass            
transit services should be increased and            
subsidies for those services to operate should      
be given; and                                       
     WHEREAS, transit agencies are feeling          
the hit of the fuel increases and as a result       
passing this cost onto the commuters; and           
      WHEREAS, as the demand for public             
transit is increasing with the rise of fuel costs,  
an enormous strain is put on bus and the rail       
transit systems, which are in desperate need        
of upgrades, expansions and operating funds;        
and                                                 
      WHEREAS, all citizens, young and old,         
rich and poor should expect mass transit which      
is user-friendly and accessible; and                
      WHEREAS, investment in mass transit           
is a productive investment and can stimulate        
immediate industrial job growth; and                
     WHEREAS, public transportation                 
reduces congestion and also reduces the             
nation's energy needs and cuts carbon               
emissions; and                                      
     WHEREAS, a need exists for a                   
comprehensive and all-inclusive initiative          
which would support the effectiveness of            
public transportation for all citizens; and         
      NOW, THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

deliberations to call upon the United States        
Congress to provide immediate funding for           
mass transit expansion and improvements of          
light rail, bus and subway systems and to           
provide immediate fuel subsidies for all mass       
transit operators to maintain or reduce current     
fares to entice more people into transit.           
      Be it further resolved that the Clerk of      
the St. Louis Board of Aldermen be instructed

    Community Tax Reinvestment                         
           Program Resolution                          
      Whereas, the St. Louis Board of                  
 Aldermen is committed to the enhancement              
 of the City's communities, businesses and             
 financial strength; and                               
       Whereas, the Treasurer of the City of           
 St. Louis manages the City's banking systems          
 and is responsible for the establishment of           
 over fifty different City banking accounts,           
 receiving deposits and reinvesting the intake         
 of cash from a variety of City sources; and           
      Whereas, the Treasurer is currently              
 responsible for investing City funds; and             
      Whereas, revenues under the                      
 supervision and control of the Treasurer              
 exceed $1.5 billion; and                              
      Whereas, the Community Tax                       
 Reinvestment Program is an economic                   
 development and community revitalization              
 incentive established to assist small businesses      
 and residential homeowners; and                       
       Whereas, the Community Tax                      
 Reinvestment Program will provide a structure         
 for the City to make municipal investments            
 into local designated financial institutions          
 which, in turn, will lend a portion of these          
 municipal deposits to eligible business and           
 homeowners at a comparably reduced interest           
 rate; and                                             
       Whereas, the municipal investments            
 made under the Community Tax Reinvestment           
 Program will benefit 1) small businesses and        
 homeowners that may have been unable to             
 secure or afford loans at the higher interest       
 rate; 2) communities dependent on economic          
 reinvestment and 3) the city at large which         
 experiences job retention, creation and             
 economic growth; and                                
       Whereas, the Community Tax                    
 Reinvestment Program may also help                  
 participating banks improve their Community         
 Reinvestment Act ratings creating a "win-win-       
 win" situation for small business owners and        
 residential homeowners, banks and the City          
 of St. Louis; and                                   
      Whereas, the City of St. Louis stands          
 to greatly benefit from the development,            
 execution and administration of the

        Now therefore be it resolved by the          
 Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis          
 that the Board of Aldermen strongly encourage       
 the Treasurer of the City of St. Louis to           
 develop, in conjunction with the President of       
 the Board of Aldermen, a Community Tax              
 Reinvestment Program to support and                 
 revitalize small businesses and residential         
 neighborhoods within the City of St. Louis.

      institutions to become approved                
      depositories for municipal investments         
      under this program;

   5) The maximum loan term for each loan            
      issued under the program;                      
   6) A monitoring and reporting process for         
      each business participating in the             
      program;                                       
   7) A monitoring and reporting process for         
      each bank participating in the program.        
 To ensure the most immediate benefit to the         
 City of St. Louis, the Board of Aldermen            
 urges the City of St. Louis Treasurer and
