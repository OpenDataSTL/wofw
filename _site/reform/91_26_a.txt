 Thee Vietnam Delegation through the               
 American Council of Young Political Leaders       
        WHEREAS, we have been apprised that        
 a delegation from Vietnam is visiting the City    
 of St. Louis on behalf of the American Council    
 of Young Political Leaders (ACYPL); and           
       WHEREAS, the American Council of            
 Young Political Leaders was founded in 1966,      
 and is a 501(c)(3) organization that conducts     
 bipartisan international exchanges, enabling      
 emerging leaders (aged 25 to 40) to experience    
 firsthand the political and cultural dynamics     
 of other countries; and                           
      WHEREAS, since their founding, more          
 than 6,000 promising young leaders from           
 around the world have participated in ACYPL       
 exchanges. Distinguished alumni include two       
 former Prime Ministers of Japan, the former       
 Prime Minister of Hungary, the Foreign            
 Minister of Australia, the Speaker of the House   
 of Representatives in Uruguay and the             
 Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee         
 of China's National People's Congress the

        WHEREAS, during their visit in the City    
 of St. Louis, the Vietnam delegation will engage  
 in candid dialogue with senior government and     
 political officials, industry executives, and     
 community leaders on a wide range of political,   
 cultural, and economic issues in the City of      
 St. Louis. For many rising leaders, an ACYPL      
 exchange program provides their first             
 substantive experience abroad and early           
 exposure to international affairs.

            Mr. David Lipman                      
     WHEREAS, we pause in our

St. Louis resident, Mr. David Lipman; and         
      WHEREAS, Mr. Lipman was managing            
editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for 14      
of his 36 years at the newspaper, died on July    
31, 2008 following an illness. He was 77 and      
had lived in Chesterfield; and                    
     WHEREAS, Mr. Lipman joined the               
Post-Dispatch in 1960 as a sportswriter and       
covered                                           
Missouri Tiger athletics before he was            
promoted to assistant sports editor in 1966.      
He rose through the ranks and, in 1979, was       
appointed managing editor, which put him in       
overall supervision of the newspaper's daily      
report; and                                       
      WHEREAS, Mr. Lipman ran the                 
newsroom until 1992, when he was promoted         
to a corporate planning post for the Pulitzer     
Publishing Co., then owner of the Post-           
Dispatch. Mr. Lipman was in charge of

newspaper's direction in the Internet age, until  
he retired in 1996; and                           
     WHEREAS, Mr. Lipman also was                 
author and co-author of seven sports books,       
including biographies of baseball players         
LeRoy "Satchel" Paige and Ken Boyer,              
football quarterbacks Jim Hart and Joe            
Namath, and baseball manager/executive            
 Branch Rickey; and                                 
       WHEREAS, In 1971, when he was one

 it                                                 
 fell to Mr. Lipman to decide whether to            
 publish some of the Pentagon Papers, a secret      
 chronicle of government documents on the           
 Vietnam War. Senior editors weren't in town.       
 Mr. Lipman decided to run them, but he called      
 it "an emotional experience. I aged                
 considerably in one day." The consequences         
 included the arrival of a federal marshal in a     
 government effort to stop publication. Of          
 whether to run them, he said, "There was no        
 question." Joseph Pulitzer Jr., then Post-         
 Dispatch publisher and pleased by Mr.              
 Lipman's decision, soon promoted him to            
 assistant managing editor.                         
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 by:                                             
 Honorable Dorothy Kirner,Alderwoman 25th Ward   
           Resolution No. 156                    
       WHEREAS, we have been apprised that       
 on Sunday, September 15, 2008 the 100th         
 Anniversary of Messiah Lutheran Church          
 will be celebrated; and                         
       WHEREAS, Messiah Lutheran Church          
 traces its roots back to a few meetings held in 
 December of 1907 when local men began a         
 discussion regarding the logistics of starting a
 congregation. After prayerful deliberation,     
 they decided to begin services on January 19th  
 1908. The first service was conducted in        
 German, and then alternated weekly between      
 German and English. Kleekamps' Hall on          
 Grand Avenue was secured for just $5 per        
 Sunday and Messiah was off and running. By      
 February, the congregation was officially       
 organized, in March it had formed its first     
 constitution and by September had called        
 Reverend William Wilk as its first pastor.      
 Eager for their own place of worship, the       
 congregation broke ground on a church building  
 at Grand and Pestalozzi in December of 1908;    
 and                                             
       WHEREAS, after only a few years, the      
 congregation had outgrown its first chapel      
 building. With the same zeal shown in the       
 origination of the church, a building campaign  
 was launched on Messiah's 20th anniversary      
 entitled, "It Can Be Done." The current home    
 of Messiah Lutheran Church was                  
 subsequently dedicated just a year later in     
 December of 1929. One of the local              
newspapers called the church a "symphony             
of charm and beauty." The church continued           
to flourish in the coming decades, and in 1948       
began serving the community with Messiah             
Lutheran School; and                                 
      WHEREAS, during the 1960s and early            
70s, however, many young families began to           
move to the suburbs, and Messiah, along with         
countless other urban churches, had to redefine      
itself in a changing neighborhood. The               
following decades brought new pastors and            
new vision for the congregation. No longer           
serving a primarily German area, Messiah             
shifted its focus to be a church for all nations.    
Now they host events that try to bring in            
school and neighborhood children, such as            
"Light up the Night," their annual evening of        
fun and food on Halloween. They also try to          
be visible in the neighborhood by caroling at        
Christmas, visiting neighbors to ask for prayer      
requests and hosting the Messiah Pumpkin             
Patch, which also serves as a fundraiser. This       
spring, they even had the chance to be featured      
on the Grand/South Grand Area House Tour;            
and                                                  
      WHEREAS, Messiah Lutheran Church               
is also one of three churches that support of        
King Glory Lutheran school with one of the           
two campuses located just across the street.         
King of Glory is striving to provide quality         
education to St. Louis. Its middle school now        
includes the Nativity Miguel model that              
features high school placement assistance and        
a longer school day offering more challenging        
opportunities for students while also                
accommodating working parents; and                   
      WHEREAS, the new millennium                    
continues to bring more change to the Tower          
Grove neighborhoods as many homes are being          
renovated and young families are moving back         
to the city. It can be difficult for a congregation  
to constantly meet the needs of its community,       
but as ambassadors of the gospel, that their         
our calling. This is a year of celebration for       
Messiah Lutheran Church, as they remember            
the past century of its worship and service.         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                            
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                 
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our           
deliberations to recognize Messiah Lutheran          
Church on its 100th Anniversary and we wish          
them continued success and accomplishment            
and we further direct the Clerk of this Board        
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the       
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a        
commemorative copy to the end that it may
