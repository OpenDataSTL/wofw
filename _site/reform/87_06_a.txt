      WHEREAS , each year the loyal                 
members of Hudson-Fauth V.F.W. Post 8888

      WHEREAS, the battle of Fort San               
Carlos is historically significant as perhaps       
the earliest and first battle of St. Louis taking   
place on our Riverfront on May 26, 1780;            
and                                                 
      WHEREAS , the British, with an                
exploratory force of 1200 men composed of           
300 mercenary troopers' and 900 natives             
under the command of Captain Emmanuel               
Hesse, attacked St. Louis which had been            
hastily fortified in anticipation of such attacks,  
these assaults were repelled by the smaller         
force of Spanish, French and Black inhabitants      
 composed of twenty five soldiers and two          
 hundred eighty one courageous townspeople;        
 and                                               
       WHEREAS , this singular meeting is          
 attributed largely to the cannon fire of the      
 town's defenders, and the wise judgement of       
 the defender of St. Louis under the Direction     
 of Captain Don Fernando de Leyba; and             
       WHEREAS , the victory over this             
 superior force of British troops and Indian       
 warriors prevented the expansion of the           
 British Empire into the Mississippi Valley        
 and allowed for the eventual purchase of the      
 Louisiana Territory by President Thomas           
 Jefferson in 1803;

 for employees of covered contracts:             
       1) Where health benefits as defined in    
 the Ordinance are provided to the employee,     
 the living wage rate is $9.79 per hour (130%    
 of the federal poverty level income guideline   
 for a family of three); and                     
       2) Where health benefits are defined in
