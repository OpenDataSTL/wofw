           OF RESOLUTIONS                         
      Mr. Bosley introduced Resolution            
 No. 239 and the Clerk was instructed to read     
 same.                                            
           Resolution No. 239                     
      WHEREAS, the Section 8 Tenant-Based         
 Assistance Program, administered by the St.      
 Louis City and St. Louis County Housing          
 Authorities, provides financial assistance to    
 thousands of residents in the St. Louis          
 Metropolitan region; and                         
       WHEREAS, the purpose of this               
 federally funded program is to assist low        
 income families in finding and maintaining       
 affordable housing; and                          
       WHEREAS, in recent years a successful      
 effort has been made to stabilize and redevelop  
 some of the older neighborhoods in the City      
 of St. Louis by encouraging the building of      
 market rate housing in order to attract more     
 middle income residents back to the city; and    
      WHEREAS, the issuance of housing            
 choice vouchers through the Section 8            
 Assistance Program and the ongoing effort to     
 redevelop our neighborhoods must be              
 coordinated in order to prevent the creation     
 of neighborhoods in which low income             
 families are clustered together; and             
       WHEREAS, permitting the creation of        
 areas which are predominantly Section 8          
 families is detrimental to neighborhood          
 revitalization and is contrary to the goal of    
 the Section 8 program; and                       
       WHEREAS, a review of the HUD               
 regulations under which the voucher program      
 is administered should be reviewed and revised   
 in order to better promote the Section 8         
 Assistance Program mission and assist in the     
 growth and development of our                    
 neighborhoods;                                   
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of the         
 City of St. Louis, that we call upon the St.     
 Louis City and St. Louis County Housing          
 Authorities to review their procedure for the    
 distribution of Section 8 vouchers to ensure
