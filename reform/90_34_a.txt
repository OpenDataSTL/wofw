       WHEREAS, sixty years after entering        
 the novitiate of the Sisters of St. Joseph of    
 Carondelet, Sister Marie Charles Buford,         
 C.S.J., enthusiastically continued her ministry  
 for thirty six years as the Executive Director   
 of the Carondelet Community Betterment           
 Federation; and                                  
       WHEREAS, always organized and a            
 stickler for detail, Sr. Marie Charles has an    
 emptier desktop these days because she is        
 retiring after thirty six years as executive     
 director of the Carondelet Community             
 Betterment Federation. She was a founding        
 member and has been its only director, a post    
 created in 1977 to manage expanding programs.    
 Her last day on the job was September 18,        
 2007; and                                        
       WHEREAS, Sr. Marie Charles was staff       
secretary for the Sisters of St. Joseph of        
Carondelet when neighborhood leaders called       
a meeting in January, 1971 to form the            
Federation. It was one of many founded in         
those days to counter the deterioration left      
by the steady exodus to the suburbs. Sr. Marie    
Charles joined the streets and alleys committee,  
quickly became board secretary and opened         
its first office in 1975; and                     
      WHEREAS, the Federation strives to          
strengthen the South St. Louis neighborhood       
by providing residents with housing               
assistance, food and clothing outreach, a         
literacy program and a senior center. Sister      
Marie Charles experiences God's fidelity in       
the charism of the Sisters of St. Joseph, love    
of God and love of neighbor; and                  
      WHEREAS, "Strength," says Sister            
Marie Charles, "comes from prayer, especially     
daily Liturgy, and the support of knowing,        
living, and working with other Sisters of St.     
Joseph and religious in the Church." With         
these resources, Sister finds, "Every day         
becomes one of peace and love of God."            
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
RESOLVED by the Board of Alderman of

as executive director of the Carondelet           
Community Betterment Federation, for her          
tenacity and dedication to the Sisters of St.     
Joseph of Carondelet, for God and the citizens    
of St. Louis. We wish her continued joy, peace    
and health in her retirement, and we pause in     
our deliberations to consider and adopt this      
Resolution and direct the Clerk of this Board     
to spread a copy of this Resolution across the    
minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a
