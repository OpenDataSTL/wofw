      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis,              
Missouri (the "City"), is a body corporate         
and political subdivision of the State of          
Missouri, duly created, organized and existing     
under and by virtue of its charter, the            
Constitution and laws of the State of Missouri     
; and                                              
      WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen               
seeks to improve the security, interoperability    
and quality of the City's computer software,       
data and information technology environment;       
and                                                
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen                
 desires to reduce the City's costs to acquire,      
 deploy and maintain its computer software,          
 data and information technology environment;        
 and                                                 
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen                
 recognizes its responsibility to protect the        
 rights of its citizens and inhabitants and to       
 guarantee the succession and permanence of          
 public software and data; and                       
       WHEREAS, there are those in the               
 technology community who believe that the           
 integrity and security of computer software         
 and data is jeopardized by proprietary              
 software systems whose security and product         
 enhancements are provided solely by the             
 software's vendor; and                              
      WHEREAS, there are those in the                
 technology community who believe that               
 vendor caprice, instability or bankruptcy           
 subject the software user to incalculable risk      
 that their computer systems may be                  
 unavailable or vulnerable to attacks by             
 malefactors whose actions can be prevented          
 only by the vendor; and                             
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen

 the City be free, to the greatest extent possible,  
 of restrictions imposed by parties outside the      
 City's control on how, and for how long, the        
 City may use the software and data it has           
 acquired; and                                       
       WHEREAS, vendors who have                     
 exclusivity to provide security maintenance         
 for their proprietary software systems have         
 the ability to charge monopoly prices; and          
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen                
 recognizes that it is not in the public interest    
 and it is a violation of the fundamental right to   
 privacy for the City to use software that, in       
 addition to its stated function, also transmits     
 data to, or allows control and modification of      
 its systems by, parties outside of the City's       
 control; and                                        
        WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen               
 desires to encourage its local economy by           
 utilizing local computer and software services      
 whenever possible; and                              
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen

 become a national leader in the efficient and       
 economical use of computer software and             
 services in government; and

 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for               
 the City of St. Louis that we direct the

 hearing for the purpose of examining whether        
 it is necessary and advisable and in the best

       1.     Section 623 of the Cable             
 Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47             
 U.S.C.  543, as amended by the Cable

       2. The Board of Aldermen of the City        
 of St. Louis, Missouri ("City"), is the

 duties delegated by the Board of Aldermen as      
 its Franchise Agency with respect to cable        
 matters under Cable Regulatory Ordinance

 not over-recovered; and                         
      7. The Federal Communications

 provide guidance to the Franchise Authority     
 in developing procedures for consistent         
 treatment of external costs;                    
    NOW THEREFORE                      BE     IT

 documentation as required under applicable      
 law, so that the City may review and assess     
 the reasonableness of such rates;.              
      C. Directs Charter to keep an              
 accounting of all charges to subscribers for    
 unreturned equipment until such time as the     
 Franchising Authority orders a Maximum          
 Permitted Rate under applicable law;

       E. Requires Charter to use the external   
 cost treatment, forms and instructions          
 mandated therein in conjunction with Form       
 1240 Worksheet 7 if and when - in the City of   
 St. Louis - Charter should elect recovery from  
 cable subscribers of costs of franchise fees on 
 non-subscriber revenues, and requires that      
 Charter only recover such costs by including    
 them in the calculations for the Basic Service  
 Tier Rate.
