       The Board of Police Commissioners            
 reserves the right to waive any formalities and    
 to reject any and all bids. The Board also         
 reserves the right to consider criteria other      
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.       
 Among other factors, the Board will consider       
 the location of the business, minority interest    
 in the business, prior performance and the bid     
 submitted in relation to the needs of the St.      
 Louis Metropolitan Police Department.              
       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.      
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of    
 the contract and the imposition of additional  
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and      
 Regulations.                                   
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations

      Bidders are also advised that the State   
 of Missouri requires workers on all public     
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.    
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the   
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or    
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than
 the prevailing rate for any work done under    
 the contract by the contractor or by any       
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).

  PUBLIC NOTICE                                 
      Board Bill No. 253 has been introduced    
 before the Board of Aldermen to amend The      
 Washington University Medical Center           
 (WUMC) Community Unit Plan (CUP) to            
 revise the CUP boundary to remove parcels      
 not owned by WUMC constituent entities         
 and to add properties acquired by WUMC         
 constituent entities. The CUP is an overlay    
 zoning district that sets forth zoning         
 regulations that are different than the

 regulations set forth in the CUP are compatible
 and consistent with the purpose of the         
 Washington University Medical Center.          
       The text of the Board Bill can be
