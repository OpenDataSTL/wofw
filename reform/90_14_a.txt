     WHEREAS                                      
      1. Section 623 of the Cable                 
Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47             
U.S.C.  543, as amended by the Cable              
Consumer Protection and Competition Act           
of 1992 ("Cable Act"), allows local franchise

rates in accordance with rules and procedures     
established by the Federal Communications         
Commission (FCC); and                             
      2. The Board of Aldermen of the City        
of St. Louis, Missouri ("City"), is the           
Franchise Authority under the City Charter;       
is empowered by Ordinance to consider and         
decide cable-related issues; adopted on June      
11, 1993, Board Resolution #47 authorizing        
its Petition for Certification and Local Rules

holds duties delegated by the Board of            
Aldermen as its Franchise Agency with respect     
to cable matters under Cable Regulatory           
Ordinance 65431, Section Thirty-Two, and

Entertainment I, LLC, doing business as           
Charter Communications ("Charter") and            
franchised to operate a cable system in the       
 City of St. Louis in accordance with terms of    
 a transfer of ownership from AT&T                
 Broadband on June 30, 2001 and its franchise     
 renewal agreement with the City of St. Louis     
 effective May 23, 2002, has submitted to the     
 City its Original FCC Form 1240, "Updating       
 Maximum Permitted Rates for Regulated            
 Cable Services," and its associated FCC Form     
 1205, "Determining Regulated Equipment and       
 Installation Costs" ("Equipment Form") both      
 dated October 13, 2006 (the "Rate Filing");      
       5. The Rate Filing from Charter

 ("MPR") of $11.68 Charter may charge City        
 subscribers for "Basic" cable service, and       
 calculates increases in the MPRs for hourly      
 service charge (HSC), equipment rental, and      
 activities including various types of            
 installations, re-connections and changes in     
 service); and                                    
      6. FCC rules (47 C.F.R. 76.937(a))          
 place the burden on the cable operator to        
 prove that its rates for basic service and       
 equipment are reasonable under applicable        
 federal law and regulations; and                 
       12. FCC rules require that the cable       
 operator follow the FCC's rules and              
 instructions with regard to preparation of Form  
 1240 and Form 1205, presenting adequate          
 support and documentation to justify the         
 operator's proposed Maximum Permitted            
 Rates; and                                       
       13. To the extent Charter fails to carry   
 its burden of proof, the City may order Charter  
 to reduce its rates and provide refunds based    
 on the information submitted by Charter and      
 /or the best available information from other    
 sources, and/or FCC rules, including a           
 previous FCC rate decision known as the          
 "Bresnan Ruling" which has particular            
 applicability to this case; and                  
      14. FCC rules allow the Local               
 Franchise Authority to (a) seek additional       
 information and supporting documentation         
 from the cable operator; (b) evaluate the        
 correctness and reasonableness of those          
 submissions; (c) use the most reliable data      
 available to determine an MPR; and (d) in the    
 context of the best information available,       
 reasonably set maximum permitted rates           
 different from those calculated by the           
 Operator; and                                    
       15. The Franchise Agency, having           
 identified certain problems, omissions, and      
 discrepancies in the Charter's Original Form     
 1240 and supporting documentation as filed       
 by Charter, sought legal and technical           
 assistance in reviewing and analyzing the Rate   
 Filing; and                                      
      16. The City's consultants, Miller &        
 Van Eaton, PLLC ("MVE") and their financial     
 consultant, Front Range Consulting, Inc.        
 ("FRC"), prepared a City-Corrected Form         
 1240 which determined that Charter 's           
 proposed MPR for the Basic Service tier did     
 not comply with FCC rules, did not use correct  
 data, was calculated incorrectly, and therefore 
 should be $11.13, not $11.68; and               
       17. The City's Local Rules provide        
 Charter ample opportunity to review and         
 comment on the City consultant's re-            
 calculations and accompanying Rate Report       
 which discussed the applicable rules,           
 corrections and analysis justifying the lower   
 rate; and                                       
      18. Charter commented on the Rate          
 Report and City Corrected Form 1240 ,           
 submitted its own May 23, 2007 Revised          
 Form 1240 indicating Charter's that the MPR     
 should be $11.33, not $11.68, and requested     
 that any further recalculation by the City      
 should take into account the actual inflation   
 factors published to date by the FCC for        
 2005-2007, and                                  
       19. The City has complied with that       
 request in its recalculation; by correctly using
 the accurate past and current inflation data    
 pursuant to FCC rules, as shown in the 2nd      
 City Corrected Form 1240 and explained in       
 the consultant's accompanying Addendum to       
 Rate Report and the 2007 Staff Report; and,     
       20. In accordance with FCC rules,         
 Charter is allowed to add a previously          
 calculated monthly System Upgrade Surcharge     
 to the Basic Service Tier rate, not to exceed   
 $0.75 for the 120 month period commencing       
 October 2003. and                               
      21. Charter's Operator Selected Rates      
 for Equipment and Installations as submitted    
 are based on national averaged cost data and    
 are equal to or less than the Maximum           
 Permitted Rates as calculated by Charter on     
 Form 1205; and                                  
       22. The Agency has supported its 2007     
 Staff Report recommendations to this Board      
 with the reports and exhibits prepared by       
 Front Range Consulting as received and          
 reviewed by the Board's Public Utilities        
 Committee.                                      
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED THAT, with regard to                   
 regulated rates in the City of St. Louis,       
 for the reasons outlined herein ,and as         
 also discussed in the 2007 Staff Report         
 and the FRC Rate Report and Addendum,           
 incorporated herein by reference, the           
 Board of Aldermen finds and resolves as         
 follows:                                        
     MAXIMUM PERMITTED RATES                     
      23. Charter has not met its burden of          
proof in supporting and justifying either its        
initial proposed Maximum Permitted Rates             
of $11.68 for the Basic Service Tier or its          
revised proposed rate of $11.33 for the period       
February 1,. 2007 through January 31, 2008.          
Charter's proposed maximum charge of                 
$12.43 and Operator-selected current charge          
of $12.42 per month (including the $0.75             
System Upgrade Surcharge) is unreasonable.           
Adjustments to the Form 1240 Filings were            
necessary, based on the City's assessment of         
accurate information.                                
     24. The descriptions, methodologies             
and calculations in FRC's 1240 Rate Report           
and Addendum are the preferable available            
basis for setting the BST rate, in accordance        
with FCC rules, and FRC's recalculations, of         
Charter's maximum permitted rates are                
reasonable and appropriate.                          
      25. For the twelve month period                
beginning February 1, 2007, the BASIC                
SERVICE TIER MAXIMUM PERMITTED                       
RATE shall be $11.13. Combined with the              
System Upgrade Surcharge of $0.75 per                
month, the total combined Basic Rate charged         
to subscribers may not exceed $11.88,                
inclusive of the regulatory fee Charter pays         
to the FCC (which Charter lists separately on        
subscriber bills) but exclusive of applicable        
franchise fees and sales taxes.                      
       26. Charter shall use the $ 11.13 MPR         
set in this Order as its starting point in carrying  
out any future required BST rate calculations..      
     27. The rates set herein are subject to         
further reduction and refund (to the extent          
permitted under applicable law and regulations       
as the same may be amended from time to              
time).                                               
     28. To the extent that any further              
change in the BST rate may be permitted              
pursuant to FCC regulations, Charter shall           
provide separate notice and explanation of           
such change pursuant to applicable law.              
     IMPLEMENTATION OF RATES                         
      29. Charter shall not charge any rate          
higher than the rates set herein, nor increase       
that rate, nor impose on subscribers any other       
charge for basic service not specified herein,       
including but not limited to bulk and                
commercial rates (to the extent such limitation      
is permitted by applicable law), unless such         
charge is first filed with and approved by the       
City, in accordance with applicable law and          
regulations, including but not limited to the        
notice requirements imposed by 47                    
C.F.R.76.1603, or as otherwise expressly             
permitted under applicable law and                   
regulations.                                         
      30. Charter may charge rates less than       
 the MPR indicated above, as long as such rates    
 are       applied in a uniform and                
 nondiscriminatory way, pursuant to applicable     
 federal, state, and local laws and regulations.   
       31. Charter shall implement the             
 $11.88 Basic Service Tier Rate on subscriber      
 bills no later than 40 days after the date of     
 this Resolution, and shall continue to list or    
 explain the BST charge as previously required.    
      32. Charter shall issue to each              
 subscriber a refund in an amount equal to the     
 $0.54 monthly overcharge for the period           
 between February 1, 2007 and actual               
 implementation of the $11.13 rate on that         
 subscriber's bill. This amount shall be placed    
 as a one-time credit on each subscriber's         
 account no later than 40 calendar days after      
 the date of this Resolution.                      
       33. Charter shall file with the Franchise   
 Agency a report submitted no later than 72        
 calendar days after the date of this order. The   
 report shall be attested to and signed by an      
 officer of the company. The Agency is hereby      
 authorized to require additional information      
 as necessary to determine compliance with         
 this Order.                                       
       36. Within 72 days from the date of         
 this Order, Charter shall file with the Agency    
 a certification, signed by an authorized          
 representative of Charter, including: (a)         
 whether and how Charter has complied fully        
 with the provisions of this order; (b) measures   
 taken to implement the specified rate; (c) an     
 accounting of ordered refunds: the amount         
 refunded to each subscriber, the date of the      
 refunds, the number of subscribers who            
 received the credit and the total amount of       
 refunds issued.                                   
                    OTHER                          
      39. The findings herein are based on the     
 representations of Charter.          Should       
 information come to the City's attention that     
 these representations were inaccurate in any      
 material way, the City reserves the right to      
 take appropriate action. This Order is not to     
 be construed as a finding that the City has       
 accepted as correct any specific entry,           
 explanation or argument made by Charter not       
 specifically addressed herein.                    
       40. The City reserves all of its rights     
 with respect to rate regulation, including, but   
 not limited to, any right it may have to reopen   
 this rate proceeding based on new information     
 or rulings by governing authority, if it appears  
 that such new information or rulings could        
 alter the reasonable rates prescribed by FCC      
 regulations, and any right the City may have      
 to "true up" overcharges or undercharges in       
 connection with future rate filings pursuant      
 to 47 C.F.R.  76.922(e)(3).                      
       41. This Order shall be effective          
 immediately upon its approval by the Board       
 of Aldermen. The rates set herein will govern    
 Charter's basic service rates until Charter      
 lawfully implements a further rate change        
 pursuant to applicable FCC regulations. This     
 Order constitutes the written decision required  
 by 47 C.F.R.  76.936(a) and shall be released    
 to the public and to Charter, and a public notice
 shall be published stating that this Order has   
 been issued and is available for review,         
 pursuant to 47 C.F.R.  76.936(b).
