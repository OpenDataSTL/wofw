           ORA LEE MALONE                       
      WHEREAS, Mrs.Ora Lee Malone was           
 a long term resident of the 21st Ward, who     
 recently passed on Tuesday, October 30,        
 2012; and                                      
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone grew up in          
 the south, experienced the relentless          
 discrimination and segregation of the 1930s    
 and 1940s, learned to resist oppression and    
 was involved in boycotts and other activities; 
 and                                            
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone moved to            
 Missouri in 1951, found employment as a        
 textile-worker and led the effort to unionize  
 the predominantly black employees of the       
 California Manufacturing Company. Mrs.         
 Malone was a veteran trade union pioneer, an   
 activist and leader in the U.S. labor movement,
 a fierce advocate for civil rights and a beacon
 of light and hope to the disenfranchised and   
 the impoverished; and                          
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone often found          
 herself many leagues ahead of the conventional 
practice - challenging status quo, pushing for   
civil rights and women's rights, raising         
questions of equity and representation for the   
dispossessed, building organizations to          
empower the powerless, organizing the            
unorganized, picketing, negotiating, lobbying    
and working with others to free victims of       
oppression; and                                  
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone joined the            
Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers         
Unions (ACTWU) staff as a business               
representative, the position from which she      
retired in January 1989. As the Union first      
Black business representative, she encountered   
resistance both from management and from         
her ACTWU colleagues; and                        
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone placed                
special emphasis on the needs of Black people    
and the needs of women of all races. She was     
a strong advocate of voter registration and      
education. She organized the St Louis Branch     
of the A. Phillip Randolph Institute. She was    
a founding member of the Coalition of Black      
Trade Unionists and served as the CBTU           
Region 8 Representative on the CBTU              
National Executive Council for 10 years; and     
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone was among             
the independent union women who organized        
the Coalition of Labor Union Women. The          
second organizing conference was held in St.     
Louis and drew 440 women. CLUW was               
founded in 1974 in Chicago at a conference       
attended by 3,000 women. Mrs. Malone said        
"many union men viewed CLWU as an                
antagonist despite its reasonable demands for    
day care facilities, female organizers to        
organize women in all industries and union       
affirmative action committees, etc" ; and        
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone was an                
internationalist whose compassion and            
concern was evidenced by her years of work       
on behalf of Africans in Southern Africa. She    
was a prime resource for films and literature    
on the liberation struggle that took place       
against the oppressive Apartheid System. In      
union conventions, she introduced resolutions    
calling for support of African workers in South  
Africa. In 1986 she was instrumental in          
arranging for 4,600 city and county high school  
students to view the outstanding film, Last      
Grave in Dimbaza, at the Fox Theatre; and        
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone frequently            
provided hospitality and accommodation in        
her home in the 21st Ward for visitors from      
Southern Africa and she sent tons of clothes,    
fabric and educational materials to Zimbabwe,    
Botswana and South Africa.; and                  
     WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone played a               
decisive role in the efforts that led to the     
passage of bills in the City of St. Louis Board  
 of Aldermen and in the Missouri General               
 Assembly, calling for the divestment of public        
 funds from corporation and banks doing                
 business in Apartheid South Africa; and               
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Malone was the                     
 oldest of nine children who often involved her        
 entire family in her many campaigns and               
 struggles.                                            
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                             
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                  
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our            
 deliberations to recognize to honor the               
 memory of Mrs. Ora Lee Malone and to thank            
 her and her family for their relentless efforts       
 to enrich and improve the quality of life for all     
 Americans, especially African Americans and           
 we direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a         
 copy of this Resolution across the minutes of         
 these proceedings and to prepare a                    
 commemorative copy to the end that it may             
 be presented to her family at a time and place        
 deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.

        Justin Thomas Seaton                           
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that              
 recently the rank of Eagle Scout was be               
 awarded to Justin Thomas Seaton; and                  
      WHEREAS, Justin is a member of Boy

 School, Thunderbird District, Greater Saint           
 Louis Area Council; and                               
      WHEREAS, Justin is a high school senior          
 at Saint Louis University High School. His            
 Eagle Scout service project was composed of           
 two separate parts, and took about a year to          
 complete. The project was designed to serve           
 a Catholic mission school in the city of St.          
 Louis; and                                            
      WHEREAS, the first part of the project           
 consisted of planting and landscaping a large         
 garden in front of Central Catholic School.           
 They dug up the dead, wilting plants and              
 replaced them with brand new bushes and               
 flowers donated through a grant given by the          
 Ladue Garden Club; and
