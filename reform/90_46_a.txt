       WHEREAS, the Shaw Neighborhood           
 has been lucky to have had several talented    
 and hardworking Neighborhood Stabilization     
 Officers over the years, but Shaw's current

      WHEREAS, Michelle's organization and

 the neighborhood of problem properties and     
 nuisance behavior over the last two and a half 
 years; and                                     
       WHEREAS, Michelle's calm demeanor        
 and understated style can be deceiving as she  
 has proved doggedly effective in aiding Shaw's 
 citizens to combat nuisances and rid the       
 neighborhood of problem properties; and        
      WHEREAS, Michelle's constant              
 professionalism in responding promptly to      
 requests, following up with concerns and       
 offering advice on tackling problems is        
 unparalleled in city government.

      WHEREAS, it had been over 30 years            
 since the Shaw Neighborhood had seen new

 homes in the 3800 block of Russell; and

 surrounding neighborhood.                          
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

            LARRY WEINLES                           
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that           
 Larry Weinles has been recognized as the Shaw      
 Neighborhood Person of the Year; and               
       WHEREAS, the Annual Historic Shaw            
 Art Fair is an integral part of the Shaw           
 Neighborhood, and is only possible through         
 the tireless efforts of scores of volunteers that  
 spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours         
 planning, organizing and staffing the event each   
 year; and

 Historic Shaw Art Fair in his role as chair of     
 the Historic Shaw Art Fair Committee; and          
      WHEREAS, Larry brings his years of            
 experience as a caterer and event promoter to      
 lead his troops of selfless volunteers through  
 the enormous task of putting on Shaw's          
 signature event that welcomes over a hundred    
 elite artists and thousands of visitors into the
 neighborhood each Fall. The result has been a   
 consistently strong and prosperous Art Fair     
 that remains a vital component to the           
 continuing improvement of the Shaw              
 Neighborhood as both a fundraiser and a         
 promotion tool; and                             
       WHEREAS, in addition to his volunteer     
 role as chair of the Art Fair, Larry has been a 
 pioneer, of sorts, as co-owner of Thurman       
 Grill, a space at the corner of Thurman and     
 Shenandoah that he continues to evolve to       
 meet the needs of the neighborhood for not      
 only a restaurant but a community gathering     
 space.                                          
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

Johnson, who served as Mother of the choir.

spirit to the choir until her death at 100 years  
of age; and
