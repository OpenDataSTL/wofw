 matters of employment, upgrading, transfer,

       The Board of Police Commissioners

 to reject any and all bids. The Board also       
 reserves the right to consider criteria other    
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.     
 Among other factors, the Board will consider     
 the location of the business, minority interest  
 in the business, prior performance and the bid   
 submitted in relation to the needs of the        
 St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department.        
       Bidders are hereby advised that the        
 St. Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and       
 associated Regulations could apply to the        
 service for which bids are being sought herein.  
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific    
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform   
 work pursuant to a contract executed between    
 the successful bidder and the City must be      
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage    
 rates and if rates are adjusted during term of  
 the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made. 
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage        
 Acknowledgment            and Acceptance        
 Declaration" with the bid. Failure to submit    
 this Declaration with the bid will result in    
 rejection of the bid. A successful bidder's     
 failure to comply with the contract provisions  
 related to the Living Wage Ordinance may        
 result in termination of the contract and the   
 imposition of additional penalties as set for in
 the Ordinance and Regulations.
