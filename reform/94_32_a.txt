      WHEREAS, we pause in our                      
 deliberations to note the passing of St. Louis     
 resident, Mrs. Catherine Keel; and              
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Catherine Keel, a            
 resident of the 4th Ward for nearly three       
 decades, made her transition on August 11,      
 2011. She sojourned on this earth nearly 85     
 years and enjoyed a life rich and full of grace;
 she possessed a loving and kind spirit-to know  
 her was to love her. Her family was her pride   
 and joy and all were model citizens of the      
 City of St. Louis and the 4th Ward; and         
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Keel was the devoted        
 wife to Mr. Mayo Keel and was a devout          
 Christian. They produced and raised four        
 wonderful children: Janice Hartlieb (Kansas     
 City, KS), Barbara Hart (Marietta, GA), Jo      
 Laverne Hardge and Wendell Keel (St. Louis).    
 For the past three years, Jo Laverne graciously 
 moved in with her parents in order to provide   
 the extra needed care they required; and        
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Keel was a member            
 of Northern Baptist for 65 years. She also      
 was a Block Unit #1435 member for               
 approximately three decades and served          
 several terms as president during the 1980's;   
 and                                             
       WHEREAS, although she was soft            
 spoken-she was always ready to protect and      
 defend the neighborhood she loved so well.      
 She and her deceased mother (Mrs. Suzie Ware    
 a.k.a. Mama Suzie) provided direction,          
 assistance and after school care to numerous    
 neighborhood children who loved them dearly.    
 Together, Sis. Catherine and Mama Suzie         
 represented "The African Village" of sorts,     
 always sharing and instilling in young people   
 the importance of "Doing the Right Thing!!!";   
 and                                             
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Catherine Keel was          
 known for a "manicured lawn and beautiful       
 flower gardens." When Mrs. Keel's health        
 began to fail a neighbor volunteered to assist- 
 but couldn't touch Mrs. Keel's green thumb      
 ability!!! She loved the Lord, all God's        
 creations and was an avid baseball fan; and     
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Catherine Keel was a        
 true example of a civic hero; she dwelled among 
 us for nearly 85 years. We're better individuals
 to have known her and the 4th Ward and City     
 of St. Louis is a better place because of her   
 hard work and commitment.                       
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

     WHEREAS, fed up with the crime in            
Lafayette Square, Michael stepped forward         
to take an active role in keeping the             
neighborhood safe by establishing the mobile      
 patrol in Lafayette Square and enlisting            
 neighbors to cruise the area each evening to        
 provide additional security for its residents.      
 He has also attended court to demonstrate the       
 neighborhood's willingness to prosecute             
 offenders, made neighbors aware of ways to          
 protect themselves, and taken many other            
 steps to create an awareness of safety issues       
 and therefore, a reduction in crime; and            
      WHEREAS, Michael is now taking his             
 model for neighborhood safety to other              
 neighborhoods throughout the City, working          
 with the Police, the Circuit Attorney, and          
 leaders in other neighborhoods to make our          
 City a better place to live, play, and work.

 have attempted to describe Award-winning         
 playwright, author, producer, and filmmaker      
 David E. Talbert; The Washington Post: "a        
 wunderkind," The Los Angeles Times: "an          
 impresario," and The San Francisco Examiner:     
 "something of a phenomenon." But, whatever       
the moniker, no one can deny Talbert's place      
as one of the most successful multi-media         
content creators in America; and                  
     WHEREAS, Mr. Talbert's 12 nationally

an unprecedented 24 NAACP nominations,

NAACP Trailblazer Award for his                   
groundbreaking accomplishments in theater;        
and                                               
     WHEREAS, Mr. Talbert burst on the            
theater scene in 1991 with the hit stage play,

Edmonds and Kirk Franklin to Tony Award           
winner Stephanie Mills, Emmy winner               
Shemar Moore and Academy Award winner             
Jamie Foxx; and                                   
      WHEREAS, in addition to his many            
successful stage productions, Mr. Talbert         
made his directorial debut with the Sony

Ice Cube, SNL alumnus and 30 Rock star

NBC television special JAMIE FOXX:

Essence Best-Selling novel BAGGAGE                
CLAIM, and LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE NO                
MORE, which he co-wrote with hip hop icon         
Snoop Dogg; and                                   
      WHEREAS, now, 20 years, 13 plays, 3         
novels, a feature film, reality show, and prime-  
time TV special later, Mr. Talbert continues

the country have come to love him for-- live      
theater. With the launch of his 13th theatrical   
production, What My Husband Doesn't               
Know, David E. Talbert brings to life a           
mesmerizing tale of lust, lies and temptation     
that puts a whole new twist on the fatal          
attraction theme.                                 
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 Honorable Dionne Flowers,Alderwoman 2nd Ward      
           Resolution No. 235                      
          Marvin Webster Gray                      
       WHEREAS, since the age of 15, Marvin        
 Webster Gray, Marvelous Entertainment, Inc.       
 CEO and national promoter, has been               
 immersed in the entertainment industry by         
 working with his father, the legendary Lewis      
 Gray, and his company Lewis Gray                  
 Productions. Lewis was the pioneer of black       
 promoters in the United States having made        
 his mark with routing and mounting the            
 famous "Motown Revue." Lewis believed in          
 the strength of the promoter and as such he       
 properly trained his son Marvin in the            
 business; and                                     
       WHEREAS, throughout his rise in the         
 business Marvin worked with many great            
 artists such as Luther Vandross, Anita Baker,     
 Marvin Gaye, Ashford & Simpson, Stevie            
 Wonder, Natalie Cole, Aretha Franklin, The        
 Jacksons, The Temptations and James               
 Brown. When Lewis Gray passed in 1989,            
 the business was firmly planted in Marvin's       
 lap. Marvin formed Marvelous Entertainment,       
 Inc. and continued promoting concerts and         
 plays in the tradition of his famous father. In   
 1990 MEI expanded its scope when Marvin           
 became the exclusive national promoter for        
 Michael Matthew's gospel plays and dedicated      
 much of his resources to the promotion of         
 Christian based entertainment; and                
       WHEREAS, today, Marvin Webster              
 Gray and Marvelous Entertainment promotes         
 and produces the variety of playwrights,          
 authors, actors and musicians. Through his        
 company, Marvin entertains millions across        
 the country. Though his life has been devoted     
 to staging the best in family entertainment he    
 is always giving something back to the people;    
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, Marvelous Entertainment            
 prides itself in working with federal, state and  
 local government agencies, radio and television   
 stations, print stations, non-profit groups, the  
 Links, the Alphas, the Deltas, the AKAs, the      
 Black Doctors Associations, the Black Nurse       
 Associations, 100 Black Men, 100 Black            
 Women, the Black Police Association, the          
 Black Firefighters Association, the Black         
 Doctors Association, the Urban League,            
 NAACP, Post Office Workers, Teachers'             
 Unions and the Interdenominational Ministers      
 Organizations and Alliances to help educate a     
 grossly under-served of Christians and Non-       
 Christians who are starved for family             
 entertainment that reflects their lifestyle; and  
       WHEREAS, for every successful event       
 he promotes, Marvin Webster Gray makes it       
 a personal rule to give back far more than he   
 ever receives. He gives full credit for his rise
 to his parents and his grandmother, his uncles  
 and his lovely wife Marcia for standing by      
 him during difficult times: and always Jesus    
 Christ. "It is through these people that God    
 continues to work his blessings," says Marvin.  
 As MEI moves deeper into the new                
 millennium, Marvin Webster Gray and his         
 growing list of partners and associates have    
 no plans to slow down. "I can do all things     
 through Christ which strengthen me," says       
 Marvin Webster Gray. "In fact that is the only  
 way I can progress."                            
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our
