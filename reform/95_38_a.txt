garage, the project included main truck ramps,    
loading docks, and the mandatory facade           
connecting the new facility to the historic       
opera house. This venture, completed in 1994,

Library and the Parking Division. Another         
Central West End development, the 28-story        
Park East Tower and Lofts built by Opus           
 Northwest LLC at Laclede and Euclid, was          
 built on land owned by the Parking Division.
