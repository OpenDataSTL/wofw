 already shown his commitment to his art; and       
      WHEREAS, he received the Platinum             
 Performance Award at the 2009 Teen Swag            
 Awards. He earned a spot on stage at the           
 Rosemount Theater in Chicago as the opening

 his talents not only as a M.C. but also as a      
 host, writer, and even a dancer; and              
       WHEREAS, Lil Bud E is an 18 year old

 18 years old, this prodigy is on his way to       
 stardom. Under Sphinx Entertainment/EMI/

 his music, but at the same time he wants to

 have fun; and

 Not only does he portray a positive image,        
 but his other songs bring out the party in you.   
 He can be hard without being hard core. He        
 can please the "young ear" without damaging       
 it. He is destined to be the savior for the hip   
 hop party sound. With determination, hard         
 work, and plenty of talent, only time can tell    
 when Lil Bud E will be the next voice of the      
 young generation; and
