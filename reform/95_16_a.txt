 Founder & CEO, Roland Williams' childhood             
 included many challenges at a young age.              
 Whether poverty, drugs, gangs, promiscuity            
 and/or uneducated behavior, Roland saw and            
 heard a lot that would have a lasting                 
 impression; and                                       
       WHEREAS, after graduating from high             
 school, Roland went on to receive a full athletic     
 scholarship to Syracuse University. As a              
 football player, Roland excelled. A three-year        
 starter and All-Big East selection tight end,         
 Roland won numerous awards; and                       
       WHEREAS, academically, Roland also              
 exceeded expectations. After earning his BS           
 degree in Speech Communications with a                
 minor in management, Roland continued his             
 education and became the first Syracuse               
 University football player ever admitted into         
 the prestigious S.I Newhouse School of Public         
 Communications Public Relations Masters        
 program; and                                   
       WHEREAS, when not on the field or in     
 the classroom, Roland also started the         
 framework for his childhood dream of creating  
 resources for youth. In his junior year, Roland
 started the Syracuse Jam Session, an outreach  
 program that exposed thousands of inner-city   
 youth to the Syracuse University campus and    
 the collegiate population. Complete with a     
 celebrity basketball game, educational         
 community booths, entertainment, food,         
 music and giveaways, the Syracuse Jam          
 Session is still the largest charity event in  
 University history coordinated by a student-   
 athlete; and                                   
       WHEREAS, in 1998, Roland's college       
 career ended when he was selected 98th overall 
 in the NFL draft by the St. Louis Rams. During 
 his rookie season with the Rams, he started in 
 14 games and earned Offensive Rookie of the    
 Year honors. In 1999, he started all 16 games  
 and was a part of the legendary "greatest show 
 on turf" team who ultimately won Super Bowl    
 XXXIV over the Tennessee Titans; and           
       WHEREAS, in 1999, Roland also            
 formally realized his childhood dream by       
 founding the "Roland Williams Youth Lifeline   
 Foundation" with its purpose to harness the    
 powerful influence of sports to download vital 
 life skills to youth in upstate New York.      
 Starting with his own capital, no paid staff,  
 and working 60 hours a week out of his guest   
 room, Roland coordinated the first ever Free   
 Football and Life Skills Camp in his hometown  
 of Rochester, NY; and                          
       WHEREAS, following the camp, the         
 response was astounding. His unique            
 combination of sports, entertainment and       
 education had captivated and inspired all      
 involved with the program. After receiving     
 feedback from dozens of athletes, entertainers 
 and business professionals, Roland realized    
 that his childhood vision had the potential to 
 impact youth far beyond his hometown. At       
 that moment, Youth Lifeline America was        
 officially born. To assist with communicating  
 the long-term vision of the charity, Roland    
 altered the name of the charity, instantly     
 making Youth Lifeline America one of the only  
 non-profit organizations in history founded    
 by a celebrity that did not bear his name or   
 likeness. This enhancement allowed Youth       
 Lifeline America to also be an inspirational   
 magnet for collaborations with celebrities,    
 business professionals and other non-profits.

     Carried unanimously by voice vote.

            Resolution No. 79                    
        A Resolution Pertaining to               
     Sweatshop Free Procurement                  
     WHEREAS, there is ample                     
documentation that abusive sweatshop             
conditions and practices are widespread in the   
global garment industry, including serious       
violations of the wage, health and safety laws   
 of relevant jurisdictions, repeated violations     
 of the core labor rights as defined by the         
 International Labor Organization, as well as       
 universally condemned practices of forced          
 labor and indentured child labor; and              
       WHEREAS, indiscriminate buying of            
 uniforms by public agencies from vendors at        
 the very end of the garment supply chain           
 easily can and frequently does result in the       
 purchase of uniforms produced in                   
 sweatshops, with the unintended                    
 consequences that public money is (1)              
 indirectly supporting the inhumane and illegal     
 activity of sweatshops, (2) giving unfair          
 advantage to sweatshop users who can offer         
 products at lower costs than operators who         
 comply with the law and rights of workers          
 and, further, (3) helping to perpetuate the        
 cycles of poverty, deprivation and poor health     
 where sweatshops dominate local economies,         
 thus promoting further social instability; and     
       WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 Supplies Division and Board of                     
 Standardization currently uses standards set       
 forth in Ordinance 62017 for purchasing goods      
 and commodities for the City.                      
      WHEREAS, Ordinance 62017 also                 
 provides that the Supply Division of the City      
 of St. Louis shall purchase supplies for all       
 departments, boards, or offices, exclusive of      
 material for public work or improvement,           
 according to standards and specifications, if      
 any, adopted or prepared by the Board of           
 Standardization and by advertising for             
 proposals thereof; and                             
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen is            
 recommending by and through this Resolution        
 that the Board of Standardization require,         
 pursuant to their power to set standards and       
 specifications, that a detailed disclosure form    
 be completed by vendors who are awarded            
 the annual contract for the City of St. Louis's    
 uniforms so that the City may document             
 where and under what workplace conditions          
 and labor practices the uniforms are being         
 produced; and                                      
      WHEREAS, the average annual                   
 expenditure in the City the last three years       
 for Uniforms and other similar items               
 (including bedding and shoes) was                  
 approximately $530,000 and, thus about             
 $530,000 of annual spending for the City of        
 St. Louis is potentially at risk of supporting a   
 sweatshop operation somewhere in the               
 world-a situation in which the Board of            
 Aldermen find unacceptable and in need of          
 remedy; and                                        
      WHEREAS, approximately 14 states,             
 counties, cities and other public entities in the  
 United States have taken steps to begin            
 sweatshop free buying, the Sweatshop-Free           
 initiative stands in need of highly visible and     
 credible leadership among public entities in        
 Missouri and Illinois, as well as nationally,       
 which leadership this City desires to provide       
 and is capable of providing;                        
       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT                         
 RESOLVED that the Board of Aldermen                 
 requests that the Board of Standardization          
 prepare standards and specifications for a          
 Comprehensive Sweatshop Free Program and            
 that such standards include the requirement         
 for the vendor to complete a procurement            
 disclosure form documenting the location of         
 the factory where the items purchased by the        
 City will be manufactured, the minimum base         
 hourly wage of the employees employed by            
 the factory, working hours of factory               
 employees, benefits provided to factory             
 employees and whether the factory is under          
 investigation for any violation of State, Federal   
 or local laws;                                      
       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the               
 City of St. Louis may join in the future the        
 national Sweatshop Free Procurement                 
 Consortium whose membership is composed             
 of three states and 12 municipalities seeking       
 the most effective ways for governmental            
 bodies to share information and resources to        
 become a single entity powerful enough to           
 positively influence the global garment             
 industry on sweatshop-free issues, including        
 monitoring and certification of manufacturers,      
 and joint purchasing contacts to gain bulk          
 discounts; and                                      
      BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that the                
 City conduct the necessary educational,             
 promotional and public relations efforts to         
 assure that the municipal staff, the community      
 and public at large are given ample                 
 opportunities to understand and appreciate          
 the rationale for the City of St. Louis'            
 sweatshop-free buying policies.
