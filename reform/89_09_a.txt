      WHEREAS, the enactment of                   
Ordinance 56054 in 1971 approved the              
adopted of the provisions of the Municipal        
Land Reutilization Law, as codified in Section    
92.700 et. seq. RSMo., as the City's procedure    
for the collection of delinquent property taxes;  
and                                               
       WHEREAS, since that time the Land

the neighborhood, full of debris and overgrown    
with weeds and not subject to taxation; and

would be properly maintained, once again

 to the property of the new owner and to the         
 entire community; and                               
      WHEREAS, the current LRA                       
 Commission appears reluctant to properly

 develop appropriate procedures designed to          
 quickly return these properties to the tax rolls;   
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 investigate the extent to which these properties    
 are in compliance with the City's health and        
 property maintenance codes and to make              
 recommendations as to how these properties          
 can be successfully returned to private
