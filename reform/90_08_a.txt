       Mr. Wessels moved that Resolutions No.     
 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35 and 36 be adopted, at

             FIRST READING                        
            OF RESOLUTIONS                        
      Mr. Bosley introduce Resolution No.         
 33 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.    
            Resolution No. 33                     
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis and          
 surrounding communities have been hit by         
 storms of late causing tens of thousands of      
 homes, businesses and institutions to be left    
 without electric power for hours at a time and   
 sometimes days; and                              
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen             
 recognizes that Ameren U. E. put crews into      
 the field and to their credit worked around the  
 clock to restore power. Thousands upon           
 thousands of food supplies, at both              
 commercial locations and at private homes,       
 were lost causing much concern and loss to       
 those without power and those whose power        
 could not be restored timely; and                
       WHEREAS, Ameren acquired the Union         
 Electric Company some time ago, and since        
 said acquisition, regular tree trimming formerly 
 performed by the Union Electric Company          
 seemed to decline; over the ensuing years area   
 trees to grow out to the extent that the storm   
 caused many branches to break and pull down      
 power lines causing massive outages; and         
      WHEREAS, these downed trees, broken         
 limbs and tree branches were all over the        
 region. In some areas these downed trees,        
 limbs and branches are still on the City streets,
alleys, vacant lots and yards where                 
homeowners are unable to do anything to             
remove them; and                                    
      WHEREAS, in an attempt to lessen the          
effect of future storms that knock out power,       
Ameren U.E. hired private contractors to trim       
trees that had the potential to knock out power     
if another storm was to come; and                   
      WHEREAS, creating further cause for           
concern to the City of St. Louis and the Board      
of Aldermen, contractors hired by Ameren did        
trim trees but regrettably left the branches        
and limbs on vacant lots, and in alleys behind      
private homes and L.R.A. properties without         
any clear plan or method to dispose of them;        
and                                                 
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis spends         
in the neighborhood of 4.5 million dollars          
yearly cleaning up illegal dump sites. These        
tree branches, limbs, and downed trees have         
stretched City resources to the point that a        
solution to the remaining tree clutter must be      
found. It is not fair or equitable for Ameren       
U.E. to expect homeowners where tree debris         
has been dumped to dispose of the branches          
and limbs at their expense, or at the City's        
expense, and                                        
      WHEREAS, the City Forestry                    
Department has been told that they, and/or          
the homeowners are responsible for the clean-       
up. It is clear that no plan of action was          
agreed upon because our neighborhoods still         
have storm debris at a level that is unacceptable.  
      NOW THEREFORE, BE IT                          
RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF                            
ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS                   
to call upon its public utilities committee and     
call for hearing to understand and make public      
who developed this plan of action, if any           
which has failed the City and its residents,        
and further to develop a plan to avoid allowing     
the ravages of storms to deface our                 
communities and create hardships for the City       
and its residents. This Resolution empowers         
the committee to call for the appearance of         
witnesses and request documents, and if             
needed subpoena and review agreements and/          
or contracts made regarding storm clean-up in       
St. Louis City and also, if possible, help to       
develop plans and procedures along with time        
tables to return our City to normalcy after         
natural disasters as expeditiously as possible.
