    St. Louis Board of Aldermen                    
    Chambers - Tue, Apr 20, 2004                   
      Mr. President, aldermen, distinguished       
 guests, ladies and gentlemen . . . my fellow St.  
 Louisans:                                         
      Good morning.                                
      It is my honor to deliver the State of the   
 City address for 2004.                            
      Last year, according to my wife, I took      
 almost an hour to deliver this speech. Since it   
 was about ninety degrees in this chamber, it      
 probably felt much longer than that.              
      I have a different plan this year.           
        With your permission, I am going to skip   
 the traditional catalog of accomplishments and    
 the annual litany of thanks to the individual     
 city workers, managers, commissioners, and        
 directors who have worked so hard to ensure       
 that City services are delivered to our           
 residents. Instead, I would like to thank         
 everyone all at once for a year of hard work -    
 and for their significant accomplishments.        
       Because of the state and national           
 economies, there are fewer City employees         
 this year than last year; more responsibilities   
 this year than last; and less help from other     
 governments this year than last.                  
       But despite these fiscal challenges, a lot  
 of hard work--innovative managers and             
 employees--and some belt-tightening have          
 actually improved the delivery of most City       
 services. Due to its employees, City              
 government is different and measurably better     
 than it was a year ago. Due to City government,   
 the City itself is immeasurably better than it    
 was a year ago.                                   
       Let me take a moment to talk about next     
 year's budget, which we will take up at E and     
 A next week. Putting together this budget         
 was not easy. We've been working on it since      
 August. We had to make tough choices. There       
 will be parts of the budget that will spark       
 intense debate. But, contrary to what you         
 may have heard, there will be no deep cuts in     
 vital City services. There will be no tax         
 increases. And, most importantly, we will         
 deliver the quality and level of services to our  
 customers that will allow us to continue the      
 progress we have seen in the last three years.    
      Through increased efficiency,                
 innovation, better management, better use of      
 technology, and tight fiscal controls, the        
 effective delivery of vital services will         
 continue to improve. For that, we can thank      
 our department directors, managers and, most     
 of all, our employees.                           
      Using the CityView program, which           
 charts the efficiency of City services, we know  
 that City government is getting much better      
 at doing things before someone complains         
 about them.                                      
       Service calls and repeat complaints for    
 everything from dirty dumpsters to tree          
 trimming have dropped -- while the numbers       
 of replaced dumpsters, repaired street lights,   
 and potholes patched within 48 hours have        
 increased. We plan better. Our employees are     
 better trained. And, everybody knows that        
 they are going to be held accountable for doing  
 the job right the first time People are starting 
 to notice that.                                  
       City neighborhoods are - as my son         
 describes things - "hot" these days. Historic    
 neighborhoods like Soulard, Lafayette Square,    
 the Central West End, and Tower Grove are        
 alive with new residents, many of them the       
 first members of their families to live in the   
 City. Houses in family neighborhoods like St.    
 Louis Hills, Skinker-DeBaliviere, and            
 Southhampton are selling for prices that would   
 stagger our parents and grandparents, who        
 pioneered them.                                  
       Some neighborhoods, like Dogtown,          
 Saint Louis Place, and the Gate District have    
 made tremendous strides in the last year, and    
 are fast becoming addresses of choice for young  
 families. As I drive up Washington Avenue at     
 night, I am amazed at the diverse mix of         
 pedestrians, new residents, tourists, and        
 curious visitors on the sidewalks. Other         
 neighborhoods, like Old North St. Louis,         
 Academy, Sherman, Fountain Park, Hyde            
 Park, and Gaslight Square, are poised to be      
 the next trendy places in the region to live.    
 The Homer G. Phillips development in the         
 Ville neighborhood is now filled. The            
 Boathouse at Forest Park is open again... and    
 the City is now home to one of the best          
 municipal golf courses in the country.           
       In addition to more than a thousand        
 newly constructed single family homes,           
 apartments and condominiums, another 7,000       
 formerly vacant and deteriorated apartment       
 buildings, ex-warehouses, former factories, old  
 schools, and retired firehouses -- and even a    
 church, a stable, an old Y, and a Shriners Temple
 -- are receiving new life as homes all over the  
 City.                                            
       In the past three years, more than 8,300   
 permits for new and substantially rehabilitated  
 homes were issued in the City. And we are on     
 track for another 3,000 in 2004. These homes     
 - rehabbed and new - are getting rave reviews    
from families, from singles, and from empty        
nesters. In some of these cases, the new homes     
are made possible with financial incentives        
from the City. But, in many more cases, market     
demand itself is making these new                  
developments possible.                             
      What accounts for this surge of interest     
in living in the City? I think there are several   
factors. One reason is that it is still possible   
to build something new in the City. We have        
space. As homebuilders look for new prime          
building sites, their real choices these days are  
narrow: the cornfields of St. Charles and the      
neighborhoods of the City of St. Louis. St.        
Charles will do fine, because there will always    
be some people with enough patience to spend       
several hours a day commuting to work,             
stores, schools, and entertainment venues.         
For the rest of us, there's City living.           
     An interesting project is the                 
Homebuilders' CitiRama project in the 18th         
Ward - the old Gaslight Square area. When          
CitiRama opens this fall, people will get a        
chance to see the range and variety of new         
homes that more than a dozen different             
homebuilders - most of them better known as        
"county builders" - are constructing in the        
City of St. Louis.                                 
      Another reason City living is hot is a       
growing regional appetite for the stability of     
established neighborhoods. Dozens of City          
neighborhoods support hundreds of                  
community organizations - from                     
neighborhood resident and business                 
associations, to ethnic clubs, to block units -    
that offer a common purpose and a sense of         
belonging in a world that is harsher and less      
civil every day. For more and more people,         
living in the City scratches a St. Louis itch      
that no other community can manage.                
      Hearing so many foreign languages            
spoken along South Grand--biking along the         
north riverfront; picnicking on the Eads           
Bridge--catching the excitement of students        
hurrying between classes at Saint Louis            
University--standing in line on The Hill with      
kids from St. Ambrose waiting for a meatball       
sub at lunch time; boating in Forest Park--        
and knowing exactly when the World's Largest       
Brewery is making a new batch are experiences      
deeply impressed into our regional and cultural    
DNA.                                               
      One strong impulse that City living          
satisfies is the need to live in the midst of our  
history. Almost every St. Louisan is a historian   
of sorts. We remember and treasure the names       
of old places. We also honor the traditions of     
the City's earliest residents and the waves of     
immigrants who followed them here. Indeed,         
only a few cities in the country - Boston,         
Savannah, New Orleans, and Charleston come         
 to mind - have managed to preserve as much         
 of their historic fabric as St. Louis.             
       In 2003, more federal historic               
 rehabilitation projects (-79 -) were completed     
 in Missouri than in any other state in the         
 country. The majority of these projects were       
 completed in the City of St. Louis. In the last    
 three years, 160 historic projects were            
 approved by the National Park Service for          
 historic tax credits. Many of these                
 developments are now under construction or         
 are complete. And even more developments           
 are using only Missouri's historic tax credits.    
      Much of our new residential                   
 development would not be possible without          
 Missouri's Historic Tax Credit. That's why I       
 am working hard with the Downtown                  
 Partnership and others to make sure that this      
 very important development incentive is            
 preserved.                                         
       That's why the Cultural Resources            
 Office, working with Aldermen and the              
 Landmarks Association, are working to get          
 additional neighborhoods and additional            
 buildings on the National Register of Historic     
 Places. And that's why neighborhood                
 associations are working to write and update       
 the ordinances regulating design and materials     
 in historic districts.                             
      During this past year, we have seen the       
 Coronado Apartments on Lindell--the Phyllis        
 Wheatley YWCA Building on Locust--                 
 hundreds of downtown loft apartments--and          
 condominiums; and a host of historic               
 rehabilitations throughout the City's              
 neighborhoods come "on line" again and be          
 met with enthusiasm.                               
       In the course of more than a thousand        
 ribbon cuttings, dinner meetings, awards           
 banquets, public speeches, fish fries, festivals,  
 and sporting events over the past year, I have     
 met many of our newest neighbors. I have           
 usually asked them to articulate what impelled     
 them to choose the City. People used different     
 words, but they said pretty much the same          
 thing. They prized City living because of how      
 their neighborhoods made them feel. They           
 liked people who said hello, who knew their        
 names, and who shared their interest in a way      
 of living that was both very special and very      
 fragile. They liked the idea that they were        
 helping to make a difference--a difference in      
 making St. Louis a great city again.               
       I have to give a lot of credit for that      
 neighborhood feeling to the priests, pastors,      
 ministers, imams, deacons, and rabbis of the       
 City. During the last year, hundreds of City       
 churches did thousands of things that knit         
 together our social fabric -- including after-     
 school programs, economic development,             
 youth recreation, senior services, neighborhood 
 clean-up, and rumor control. A half dozen       
 times this past year, I have had to pick up my  
 phone and ask for their help. Not once did      
 any of these religious men or women say that    
 they thought that the City's business was none  
 of their business.                              
       I also have to give credit to Police Chief
 Joe Mokwa and to Fire Chief Sherman George      
 - and to the very brave men and women who       
 serve with them. Feeling safer -and really being
 safer - have made City living more attractive   
 to more people. The reduction in crime in St.   
 Louis has generated banner headlines in         
 newspapers across the country. Our police       
 officers and our firefighters do their work well
 and bravely. And the training and readiness of  
 both departments have improved sharply          
 under their current chiefs.                     
       I want to detour for a moment to say      
 something about a civilian review board for     
 the Police Department. I agree with the need    
 for an independent review process. Because      
 of an arcane twist of state law, the control and
 direction of the City police department is      
 vested not in City government, but in state     
 government. When done right, a review board     
 whose members are selected by someone other     
 than a governor or the state senate could       
 increase the accountability of the police       
 department to the people it serves and protects 
 - and build new bridges of trust to the         
 community. Working with the Clergy              
 Coalition, police officers, community groups,   
 business groups, and Alderman Terry             
 Kennedy, I hope to find such a board in place   
 when I speak next year.                         
      There's a good reason I give this speech   
 in April. I think the City looks best in the    
 Spring. I find it easier to make my case when   
 the daffodils are out and the parks are newly   
 green.                                          
       This year, a fully refurbished Forest Park
 is the clear star - but, other parks, community 
 gardens, and green spaces in the City are       
 showing off this month and getting ready for    
 a busy summer of use. If you live in the City,  
 you live near a park. And no City park is       
 simply for show. Our parks are all hardworking  
 parks - green spaces to walk, to run, to skate, 
 to bike, or just to think. Each is a point of   
 pride of its neighborhood, guarded jealously    
 as a treasure. Taken together, they are some    
 of the magnets that hold our neighborhoods      
 together and some of the amenities that         
 distinguish us from most other places.          
      Is the 4th grade class from Dewey          
 International Studies School in the gallery?    
 Please stand up and say hello. [HELLO]          
 Thank you. Please sit down again. I invited     
 these students here today because one of them   
had expressed an interest in coming to City        
Hall--and because I wanted them to remind          
all of us of something--something we may           
have lost sight of in the last year. I said three  
years ago that St. Louis would never be a great    
city-- that St. Louis would never be a simple      
choice for young families-- unless the City        
cultivated a network of great schools. Great       
public schools--great parochial schools--          
great private schools--great charter schools.      
      There are 65,000 children like my 4th        
grade audience living in the City this morning.    
There are easily that many more living in St.      
Clair County or St. Louis County, or other         
parts of the region, whose parents would           
happily live in the City if great schools were     
easier to find. We do not need to start from       
scratch. There are already dozens of great         
schools in the City. Their names are Laclede,      
Peabody, Kennard, Hamilton . . . and Dewey.        
New City, St. Gabe's, SLU High, Metro, St.         
Roch's. The problem is that we need hundreds       
more of them.                                      
      All schools face challenging times these     
days. The battle for children's minds and souls    
has never been fiercer - or more urgent. Every     
child we lose to boredom, apathy, drugs, crime,    
chronic poverty, or the universe of low-           
paying, dead-end jobs is a civic tragedy - and     
an indictment of our own citizenship.              
       During the past year, the St. Louis Board   
of Education and its managers have made            
unprecedented changes to the business side         
of the St. Louis public schools. A district that   
was teetering on the brink of insolvency has       
taken an important step or two away from           
the edge. Interim superintendent Bill Roberti      
and his team deserve credit for looking at a       
problem more clearly than we ever did - and        
for having the professionalism to be the only      
set of out-of-town consultants I can recall who    
actually wrote a plan - and then followed it       
through.                                           
      With an efficient management system          
now in service to our schools, the primary         
focus can be on children and learning, instead     
of on buses, bills, buildings, and bonds. A        
new superintendent will be announced               
sometime in the next few weeks. It is the worst    
kept secret in St. Louis that the Board of         
Education hopes to hire Dr. Rudy Crew, the         
former chancellor of the New York Schools,         
to take over here in St. Louis. I have read that   
Dr. Crew is currently considering competing        
offers from other districts, as well as from St.   
Louis.                                             
      I have met Dr. Crew, and I have been         
most impressed by two things about him. He         
believes that the children of urban America        
have been failed by a community's selfish lack     
of faith and effort - by bad schools, untrained    
 principals, over-worked teachers, and                 
 disinterested parents. And, he believes that          
 good schools, charismatic principals, well-           
 trained and well-compensated teachers, and            
 involved parents are the solutions to the             
 problems faced by our children.                       
       I have heard it said that Dr. Crew does         
 not always agree with his mayors. Well, should        
 he choose St. Louis, he ought to know that            
 this mayor agrees with him: the only reason a         
 school district exists is to educate our children.    
 I hope he chooses St. Louis. I know he likes          
 old buildings, baseball, and football. We can         
 certainly oblige him because we are                   
 competitive in all of those things. There will        
 be a new ballpark ready for him in two seasons        
 - and, if he has any strong feelings in the           
 matter, I am certain that Coach Martz would           
 welcome another opinion about a starting              
 quarterback for the Rams. I know Dr. Crew             
 likes to eat out - and the state of the City's        
 restaurants is very strong. In fact, it is so strong  
 that County Executive Charlie Dooley and I            
 recently had to draft Ozzie Smith as the              
 region's Fitness Czar to remind us to temper          
 St. Louis' plenty with a little common sense          
 and with some exercise in those neighborhood          
 parks.                                                
       I have had a little fun with the idea, but      
 the need is dead serious. We need more good           
 public schools. The City needs more great             
 educational choices. And I think the St. Louis        
 Public Schools need a world-class                     
 superintendent like Dr. Crew. What could              
 keep him - or anyone else - away from the             
 City?                                                 
       Well, I remain very concerned about the         
 airport. Until 9-11, Lambert was the envy of          
 the rest of City government. The airport had          
 money; the airport had glitz; the airport was a       
 major airline hub. Now all of that has changed:       
 hubs are going out of fashion; the airport has        
 had to tighten its belt for the first time in its     
 history; and the airport's glitz has now been         
 replaced with the same worry lines that show          
 on the faces of every department director in          
 this City. The best news for Lambert is that          
 the region is pulling together to tackle its          
 problems head-on. I am confident that we will         
 succeed and Lambert Airport will once again           
 be an economic engine driving the City and            
 the region's economy.                                 
       I am also worried about public                  
 transportation. In St. Louis, that means buses        
 and light rail.                                       
 Right now, public transportation is                   
 struggling--in large part because nearly              
 everyone in the region who has the money              
 owns a car and insists on keeping that car            
 glued to their posteriors day in and day out.         
 For these people, Metrolink is a ride to the          
 hockey game or to the airport. And that makes    
 the need for a good public transportation        
 system seem less than urgent. Some other         
 people already know how important it is. For     
 an important part of the City's population,      
 public transportation is their only source of    
 mobility. And they already understand that       
 improving the system, keeping its                
 management responsive to the community, and      
 controlling its costs are urgent needs right now.
       But I also urge our individual drivers to  
 look into the future, as well. Some day not      
 too long from now--when downtown is so           
 desirable and crowded by so many people          
 and businesses--when parking is so expensive     
 that even a person with a perfectly good Lexus   
 will want to leave it at home--those trains      
 and buses are going to look a lot better. And    
 getting the system to the point where people     
 of all incomes find it accessible, convenient,   
 attractive, and safe is going to require some    
 choices in the coming year.                      
       There's much better news about roads       
 and bridges. We are very close to being "caught  
 up" with the backlog of road and bridge          
 projects that had been languishing when I took   
 office. And we are beginning to embark on        
 new street and bridge initiatives that will not  
 only make our streets and bridges safer but      
 will make our neighborhoods more attractive.     
 We've seen what these street enhancements        
 can do on Washington Avenue, North               
 Broadway, Delmar, Interstate 70, and             
 Lindell--and very soon we will be seeing         
 similar improvements on South Grand,             
 Maryland, and Dr. Martin Luther King Drive.      
      Let me conclude by talking about some       
 other serious issues.                            
       For too many years, too many families      
 have lived in very old homes that have not       
 been maintained. Children in these families      
 have been systematically poisoned by lead        
 paint and by lead in the soil of their yards.    
 This past year we have embarked on a plan -      
 a very ambitious plan - to eliminate childhood   
 lead poisoning by 2010. With a lot of            
 coordinated effort from a lot of people--        
 people in City departments, people in the        
 community, Senator Kit Bond, Dr. Benjamin        
 Hooks, and former St. Louisan Al Jackson,        
 who now heads up the Department of               
 Housing & Urban Development -- we are            
 amassing the resources necessary to attack       
 this problem head on. And by next year I will    
 be in a position to report to you on our         
 progress.                                        
      We have also weathered a bad storm with     
 respect to the structure of our health           
 department. For too many years, that             
 department has struggled to meet its             
 responsibilities. When I hired the last director,
I thought he was a great choice, that he would    
learn to like St. Louis, and that he would be     
our partner in changing the direction of the      
City's health department. That did not work       
out. We are back to square one on the issue of    
the Health Department's organization and          
function. We are working now to craft a           
consensus among public health professionals       
as to what the City Health Department should      
be, how it should get there, and how we will      
pay for it.                                       
      I do not think it is possible to speak      
about St. Louis without talking about race.       
White flight from the City, the migration of      
the black middle class, and segregated housing    
in the County has left the region deeply bruised  
by its past. While St. Louis is often described   
as one of the most segregated regions in the      
country, a prominent publication recently         
noted that St. Louis City is now one of the       
most integrated cities in the country. Although   
misunderstandings still out-number                
collaborations, I think that - particularly in    
the City - we have made some important            
progress.                                         
     On city blocks where blacks and whites       
live door-to-door and yard-to-yard, the           
common challenges of a neighborhood more          
often overshadow the old suspicions.              
Measured on a block-by-block basis, more          
and more of our neighborhoods are now at the      
point where people of all races live              
comfortably together--and take great joy in       
doing so.                                         
       One interesting statistic that our         
Planning Department has noticed is the gradual    
return of the black middle class to the City.     
It's still a trickle, but it is measurable. Mary  
"One" Johnson, a City realtor and developer       
who serves on a couple of important City          
commissions, says that she has never been         
busier. Mary "One" is color-blind when it         
comes to selling houses, but she says there is    
a strong, growing market for two hundred          
thousand dollar homes in north St. Louis.         
      And this may be best news about the         
state of the City that I have to report.          
      It is as if those of us who love City       
living are coming to realize that we have a lot   
in common with each other--that we have           
more similarities than we have differences.       
When I first became mayor, people told me         
that making St. Louis a great city again was an   
impossible task.                                  
      People told me that I should pick just a    
few things to work on and be happy with           
solving just a few problems, because there        
were far too many issues for one Mayor and        
one City government to even think of solving.     
I disagreed then--and I disagree now.             
      I believe that we have to address            
 everything at once. A great city is measured      
 not just by its convention hotel, by its          
 ballpark, by its health department, or by its     
 schools. A great city is measured by the quality  
 of each of its aspects and the way in which       
 each works together to support the other.         
 Housing and schools, schools and jobs, jobs       
 and revenues for social services, lead            
 poisoning and education, jobs and                 
 transportation. They all fit together like a      
 puzzle.                                           
       So, I've approached my job as Mayor         
 as a pluralist, as a team player, and as a true   
 believer in our City. We are making progress      
 with business, public safety, retail, schools,    
 housing, lead poisoning, ballparks, parks,        
 casinos, problem properties, streets, bridges,    
 MetroLink, race relations . . .                   
       And because we are making moves in so       
 many different directions, people - a lot of      
 people - are noticing. And because they like      
 what we are doing, their attitudes about the      
 City are changing. And because their attitudes    
 are changing, existing businesses are staying--   
 and new businesses are considering moving         
 here. People who already live here are making     
 improvements to their homes--and people           
 from the County are giving City living a shot.    
        I want to close, as I opened, by thanking  
 everyone - everyone in this room, everyone        
 in the business community, everyone in our        
 neighborhoods - for being part of the team        
 that is making the City great again. I'm proud    
 of what we've accomplished this past year,        
 and I hope that you are too. We've done a lot,    
 and we have lot to show for our work.             
     Nothing that I have said this morning         
 means that we don't still have a long way to      
 go. We do.                                        
       But we have made important progress         
 in the last year: we have reawakened the belief   
 that the City of St. Louis is the region's true   
 heart and real soul. I look forward to working    
 with all of you during the coming year,           
 dreaming great dreams and then working hard       
 on making them reality.                           
      Thank you. And God bless you.
