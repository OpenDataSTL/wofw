 Commissioners of the St. Louis Metropolitan    
 Police Department shall be entitled to recover

       The Board of Police Commissioners        
 reserves the right to waive any formalities and
 to reject any and all bids. The Board also     
 reserves the right to consider criteria other  
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.   
 Among other factors, the Board will consider   
 the location of the business, minority interest
 in the business, prior performance and the bid 
 submitted in relation to the needs of the St.  
 Louis Metropolitan Police Department.          
      Bidders are hereby advised that the St.      
Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
associated Regulations could apply to the          
service for which bids are being sought herein.    
This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
work pursuant to a contract executed between       
the successful bidder and the City must be         
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.                                       
      Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations      
are available upon request from Carol Shepard,

     Bidders are also advised that the State       
of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under        
the contract by the contractor or by any           
subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).
