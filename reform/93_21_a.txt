This Ordinance requires that, unless specific       
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform       
work pursuant to a contract executed between        
the successful bidder and the City must be

applicable rates after such adjustment is made.     
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage            
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration           
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration    
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.   
A successful bidder's failure to comply with        
the contract provisions related to the Living       
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of         
the contract and the imposition of additional       
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and           
Regulations.

The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the        
contracting public body of $100 per day (or
