 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and

 work pursuant to a contract executed between    
 the successful bidder and the City must be      
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage    
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term 
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,      
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.

with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.

the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and

of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under
