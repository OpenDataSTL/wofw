the two St. Louis City jails, the City Justice   
Center and the Medium Security                   
Institute(CJC/MSI) and later issued a report     
on their findings in 2009; and

      WHEREAS, according to those                
interviewed,       human       dignity       is

covered up regularly by officials at both        
facilities. The accounts of both the COs and     
inmates are consistent; and

     WHEREAS, since this report has been         
 issued there have been continued problems at       
 the City jails indicating that it is imperative    
 that the St Louis Board of Aldermen have a         
 full understanding and comprehension of the        
 issues alleged in this report; and                 
      WHEREAS, shortly after the issuance           
 of the ACLU report the in 2009 the Public          
 Safety Committee of the Board of Aldermen          
 held hearings to discuss the ACLU findings

 representatives and representatives of the

       WHEREAS, after listening to all the          
 testimony the Public Safety Committee              
 determined by vote to convene a work group         
 composed of the City Public Safety Director,

 representatives and the Vice Chair of the Public   
 Safety Committee of the Board of Aldermen          
 to discuss ways the issues can be addressed;       
 and                                                
       WHEREAS, after many discussions and          
 review of data this work group determined          
 that a civilian review process for the City jails  
 would be the best recommendation for               
 improvement but was unable to complete the         
 design of it recommendation due to the ending      
 of the Board of Aldermen's legislative session.

 and develop and design recommendations for         
 improvements that it may deem necessary and

 such discussions the Director of the
