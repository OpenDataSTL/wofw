 Dear Parrie and Dave:                              
       Enclosed, please find a copy (original to    
 the Office of the Register, copy of same to        
 the Board of Aldermen) of the Filing of

 the county clerk of each county in which a         
 portion of the [...] district lies, who shall cause
 the same to be spread upon the records of the      
 county commission." Due to the wording of          
 this requirement, I am requesting, in addition     
 to its filing with the Office of the Register,     
 that the enclosed be placed on the Board of        
 Aldermen's agenda for acceptance. Thank you.       
      If you have any questions, please do          
 not hesitate to ask.                               
       Very truly yours,

      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that

       WHEREAS, the conference is held to

 Honorable Samuel L. Moore,Alderman 4th Ward    
           Resolution No. 357                   
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that       
 from April 30-May 1, 2008 the 2008 Chinese     
 Spectacular, a world-class theatrical          
 performance that showcases the essence of      
 Chinese fine arts will be performing at the    
 Touhill Performance Arts Center; and           
       WHEREAS, the Chinese Spectacular         
 aims to deliver the beauty and elegance of     
 traditionally        inspired,      originally 
 choreographed Chinese classical dance to       
 audiences throughout St. Louis and its nearby  
 areas. The Chinese Spectacular is part of a    
 global tour that is performing in over 60 major
 cities worldwide and is estimated to reach     
 650,000 people, and it had graced the world's  
 most prestigious theaters, such as New York    
 City's Radio City Music Hall, Las Angeles'     
 Kodak Theater, Chicago's Arie Crown            
 Theater, San Francisco's Opera House, and      
 Paris' Le Palais des Congress; and             
        WHEREAS, China is known as "The         
 Land of the Divine." For 5,000 years, its      
 divinely imparted culture, including Chinese   
dance, music and other art forms had been         
continuously refined as its elegance              
developed. Unfortunately, authentic Chinese       
performing arts have been absent from the         
world stage for several decades as much of the    
essence of traditional Chinese culture has faded  
from memory. The core values of Chinese           
culture: benevolence, righteousness,              
propriety, wisdom, and faithfulness, once the     
universal standards of human of human life,       
were discarded in the wake of China's Cultural    
Revolution; and                                   
     WHEREAS, the Chinese Spectacular is          
hosted by the Sound of Hope Radio NFP, a          
501(c) (3) nonprofit organization which has       
been serving the community by producing and       
broadcasting news and cultural programming,       
promoting and improving cross-cultural            
understanding and organizing special cultural     
events and is co-hosted by the Mid-USA Falun      
Dafa Association, whose mission is to promote     
the universal principles of truthfulness,         
benevolence and forbearance.                      
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

Spectacular and we wish them continued

 throughout St. Louis by either walking or use

      WHEREAS, the district-wide program           
has challenged all students to read a minimum      
of twenty minutes each day outside of the          
classroom. The goal is to encourage children       
and teenagers to develop strong, lifelong          
reading habits, view reading as a rewarding        
leisure activity and engage parents/guardians      
in their children's educations; and                
     WHEREAS, from January through

events featuring guest readers. Elected officials  
read at the schools on January 4th and 11th.

February 14th and on February 29th the             
schools welcomed members of the clergy             
community for Faith-Based Reading Day; and         
     WHEREAS, each school is also                  
encouraged to give books to students and           
parents and chart student progress. District-      
wide minute totals have been announced             
monthly; and                                       
       WHEREAS, MICDS (Mary Institute              
 and St. Louis Country Day School) and other       
 local organizations have donated thousands

 A-Bear Workshop, Inc., are partnering with        
 the district to provide books and funding and     
 area churches, temples and synagogues are         
 conducting book drives and encouraging            
 members to read.
