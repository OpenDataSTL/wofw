     2. Under 32 of Cable Regulatory Code

Communications Entertainment I, LLC, doing          
business as Charter Communications

"Form 1235 Filing"), along with FCC Forms           
1240 and 1205 (the "Form 1240 Filing").             
       4. Under FCC regulations, Form 1235,

requested by Charter is permitted under             
applicable FCC regulations, Charter will need       
to supply information regarding the Form            
1235 Filing sufficient to carry its burden of       
proof pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.937(a).              
      6. Accordingly, the City will require         
additional time to review the Form 1235 Filing.     
      7. The City's deadline for acting on          
Charter's Form 1235 Filing, and any                 
implementation of rates based on the Form           
1235 Filing, are hereby tolled for 150 days, in     
addition to the initial thirty-day review period,   
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.933.                       
      8. This Order shall not affect the review     
periods for the Form 1240 Filing as set forth       
in 47 C.F.R. 76.933(g).                             
      9. Charter shall maintain records so that     
it can refund to subscribers any amounts later      
found to be unreasonable, plus interest.            
     10. This Order is the Order required by        
47 C.F.R. 76.933(b) with regard to the Form         
1235 Filing.
