 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific

 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term

 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration

 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.

 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than
