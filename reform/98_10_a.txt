 and admonition of the Lord; and

           ORDINANCE #69431                      
              Board Bill No. 295                   
     Committee Substitute As Amended               
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,         
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining        
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section       
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of       
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the    
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder   
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new        
 provision on the same subject matter;             
 containing severability clause.                   
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek        
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.      
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with      
 businesses from other areas because of the        
 higher administrative costs of doing business     
 in the City;                                      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis               
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in      
 the City and to relocate to the City;             
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local                
 preference law that allows a local firm to match  
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%          
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to      
 encourage and stimulate local business.           
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF                
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part               
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.       
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                 
 thereof is the following new section.             
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                  
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time    
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the      
 presence of such bidders as desire to be          
 present, and shall be open to the inspection      
 of bidders.                                       
       B. The bids shall not be materially         
 modified or amended as to price, specification    
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,   
 after opening except when the lowest bid is       
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid      
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder      
 within two percent of the lowest bid may          
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches   
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner      
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If      
 more than one local bidder is within two          
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest   
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other      
 circumstances, modification, supplementation      
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.    
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder        
 means a bidder whose principal place of           
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has     
 had a valid business license for at least one     
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
 Principal place of business shall be defined as  
 the business's physical office, plant, or site   
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
 business regularly work and conduct business,    
 or where the plant or office and equipment       
 required for the furnishing of the goods or      
 performance of the services provided to the      
 City, as required by the contract, are physically
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
 the bid.                                         
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
 specific bid on each article. The award may be   
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
 or any part thereof, but the Board of            
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
 any part of any bid.                             
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                
       The provisions of this section are         
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
 can be given effect without the invalid          
 provision.                                       
 Approved: April 29, 2013                         
      The right to reject any and all bids is     
 reserved
