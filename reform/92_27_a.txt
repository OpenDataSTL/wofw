 ecumenically-minded, freedom-loving                   
 churches cooperating in fulfilling the mission

 of which can be a cleric. The voting delegates     
 are the primary authority of the Council's life.

 The trustees and officers oversee and conduct      
 the Council's business between Conferences;

          Resolution No. 100                     
        Service International                    
       WHEREAS, we have been apprised that       
 Service International's "Love The               
 Neighborhood" community outreach event          
 will be held on Saturday, July 25, 2009; and    
       WHEREAS, Service International helps      
 people in spiritual, physical, and situational  
 crises. Their programs are unique and our       
 follow-through is unparalleled; and             
       WHEREAS, when disaster strikes,           
 government and relief organizations converge    
 on the scene with food, water, and other        
 necessary supplies.           While Service     
 International also provides immediate disaster  
 relief, their focus is on complete, long-term   
 recovery. Their primary goal is to make each    
 community they serve capable of continuing      
 its own restoration program long after they     
 have gone. In order to accomplish that task,    
 Service International trains residents and local
 authorities in volunteer and material           
 coordination as well as reconstruction          
 techniques; and                                 
      WHEREAS, the communities that              
 Service International helps end up better than  
 they were before their catastrophe. Natural     
 disaster is an equal opportunity destroyer,     
 and recovery must also be equal opportunity.    
 Racial, religious, and social barriers come     
 crashing down as entire communities pull        
together for survival. The benefits of this       
kind of recovery will last for generations; and   
     WHEREAS, as well as providing                
disaster relief services, Service International   
has partnered with other organizations in a       
variety of humanitarian projects: receiving       
donations of winter coats for the needy,          
serving nutritious summertime lunches to St.      
Louis school children and providing food          
supplies and support for Thanksgiving.            
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our       
deliberations to recognize Service International  
and we direct the Clerk of this Board to spread   
a copy of this Resolution across the minutes      
of these proceedings and to further prepare a     
commemorative copy to the end that it may

place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.          
Introduced on the 23rd day of July, 2009 by       
Honorable Gregory J. Carter,Alderman 27th Ward    
          Resolution No. 101                      
      Ernestine F. Jones-Gordon                   
      WHEREAS, Ernestine F. Jones-Gordon          
was born to Deacon Ernest and Deaconess           
Helen Jones in St. Louis on August 5, 1949.       
Ernestine was a happy child and soon became       
a child musical prodigy; singing, playing, and    
directing choirs and groups. At the age of 9,     
she became a member of the Jones Singers and      
at the age of 12 she played for the Wilson        
Singers under the direction of Mr. LeRoy          
Wilson of Wilson Funeral Home. Ernestine          
was educated in the St. Louis Public Schools      
system, she attended Marquette Elementary         
School and Vashon High School; and                
     WHEREAS, during her teen years, she          
became a high achieving student at Vashon         
High School and was involved in many school       
activities including the concert choir,           
majorettes, and student government. Her most      
memorable experiences included performances       
with Dr. Helen Louise Graves and the              
Cosmopolitan Singers. She later attended          
Fontbonne University where she majored in         
vocal performance; and                            
      WHEREAS, as Ernestine developed             
into a beautiful young woman, she later           
married and had two beautiful children, Kristy    
and Neil, II. Her musical gifts allowed her to    
travel near and far performing in musicals, folk  
operas and sacred concerts from New York to       
California. She has shared the stage with such    
gospel greats as Evangelist Shirley Caesar,       
James Cleveland and many others. Her talent       
soon landed her on Broadway in the 1970's.        
Ernestine starred as Serena in the Opera Porgy    
and Bess at Eastman Theater under the             
direction of Mr. Archie Savage. Her road to       
 fame soon took a turn, as leaving her new           
 family to pursue her dream was too much for         
 her to bear. This would be the beginning of         
 many professional sacrifices that she would         
 make for the love of her family; and                
       WHEREAS, Ernestine's love of music            
 could not be contained; she decided to become       
 an entrepreneur and an elementary music             
 teacher which allowed her to share her musical      
 gifts and passion for music with others. She        
 opened Berry, Jones, and Foster music studio,       
 in memory of her maternal and paternal              
 grandparents, where she taught private piano        
 and voice for nearly 20 years. She also was a       
 music teacher at Bishop Healy School and            
 Shepherd Accelerated School for a total of 30       
 years; and                                          
       WHEREAS, Ernestine is still using her         
 gifts to bless others. She serves as the            
 children's choir pianist and director of the dance  
 ministry at Central Baptist Church, her church      
 of 60 years. Over the years, Ernestine has          
 been a part of various ministries of the church     
 including the Treblettes (affectionately called     
 The "Trouble" Lettes), under the direction of       
 Dr. Elizabeth Maddox Huntley; The Chancel           
 Choir, under the direction of Mrs. Mildred          
 Bailey; Central Baptist Church Inspirational        
 Choir, which she organized and directed and         
 was the Assistant Minister of Music.                
 Ernestine also shared her musical gifts with        
 many churches and community choirs                  
 including; St. Nicholas Catholic Church             
 Children's Choir and Wayman AME; and                
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

         Margaret Bush Wilson                          
       WHEREAS, one of St. Louis' finest               
 citizens Margaret Bush Wilson, a civil rights         
 pioneer, leader, attorney, and business               
 executive, passed on August 11, 2009; and             
        WHEREAS, she was born January 30,              
 1919, the second of three children. She               
 received an early education on civil rights and       
 public service as her mother, Margaret Casey          
 Bush, was on the executive committee of the           
 local NAACP. Her father, James T. Bush ,              
 was a real estate agent and financially backed        
 civil rights causes; and                              
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Wilson attended                   
 Sumner High School and graduated in 1935.             
 After high school, she attended Talladega             
 College and earned a degree in economics with         
 a minor in mathematics. While attending               
 Talladega, Mrs. Wilson was awarded the Julia          
 Prescott Fellowship to study abroad in India,         
 where she met Mahatma Ghandi and Nobel                
 Prize winning poet, Rabindranath Tragore.             
 After graduation, she attended Lincoln                
 University Law School and earned her law              
 degree in 1943 and became, at that time, only         
 the second African American female to practice        
 law in Missouri; and                                  
       WHEREAS, after working a few years              
 for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural        
 Electrification Administration, Mrs. Wilson           
 married a law school classmate, Robert Wilson         
 Jr. and they set up a law practice in St. Louis.      
 She joined the legal team on the historic Shelley     
 v. Kraemer case, which challenged housing             
 covenants that excluded African Americans             
 and Jewish people from certain neighborhoods    
 in St. Louis and other cities. The case, which  
 came out of her father's real estate dealings,  
 went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,     
 which ruled in 1948 that the covenants were     
 unenforceable; and                              
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Wilson presided over        
 the St. Louis Chapter of the NAACP during       
 the historic Jefferson Bank demonstrations.     
 In early 1960, she organized the first statewide
 NAACP conference in Missouri which              
 became the Missouri State Conference of         
 NAACP Branches, of which she also served        
 as President. After presiding over the City     
 and State branches of the NAACP, Mrs.           
 Wilson became the first African American        
 woman to head the national NAACP. She held      
 the position of national chair for nine         
 consecutive terms. When asked by male board     
 members "What shall we call you?                
 Chairperson? Chairlady?" she responded "As      
 long as you recognize that I'm the Chairman     
 of the Board, I don't care what you call me";   
 and                                             
      WHEREAS, she was a life member of          
 the Mound City Bar Association (MCBA)           
 and a life member of the National Bar           
 Association (NBA). She was a Charter            
 Inductee into the NBA's Hall of Fame in 1986;   
 a recipient of the Presidential Lifetime        
 Achievement Award in 1992 at the NBA's          
 67th Annual Meeting in St. Louis; and the       
 recipient of numerous other recognitions        
 during her life; and                            
       WHEREAS, Margaret Bush Wilson's           
 young life was touched by social and civil      
 rights advancements and in her adult life she   
 spearheaded social and civil rights             
 advancements.                                   
 She was undoubtedly one of St. Louis' greatest  
 citizens and she was always willing and able    
 to assume roles of leadership and fight for the 
 right reasons; and                              
       WHEREAS, Mrs. Wilson was preceded         
 in death by both her parents, as well as her    
 husband, and her older brother, James T. Bush   
 Jr. Her sister, Ermine Byas, lives in Rochester,
 NY and her son, Robert Wilson, lives in Rio     
 De Janeiro.                                     
       NOW THEREFORE IT BE                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

           Resolution No. 130                   
       Monsignor Louis F. Meyer P.A.,           
   Pastor Emeritus, St. Mary Magdalen           
       WHEREAS, Monsignor Louis F.              
 Meyer, a man who truly embodies the spirit     
 of the "CYC", now a unit of the Catholic Youth 
 Apostolate, celebrated his 65th anniversary    
 as an ordained priest in May, 2009, and he     
 will be 90 years young in October. During his  
 life-long service to youth, Msgr. Meyer has    
 been recognized locally, regionally and        
 nationally for his contribution and dedication 
 to the youth of this country. He has brought   
 great credit to the CYC through his            
 involvement in our community; and              
       WHEREAS, Monsignor Louis F. Meyer        
 has reflected on encounters with future        
 politicians and future sports broadcasters     
 when they were youngsters in his parish.       
 Monsignor Meyer talks about his friendship     
 with Bob Broeg, the late Baseball Hall of Fame 
 sports editor of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  
 He also talks about football stars he met while
 saying Mass for opposing professional teams    
 back when the football Cardinals were in St.   
 Louis and his appearances with Brazil's        
 natural treasure, soccer legend, Pele; and     
       WHEREAS, from 1946 to 1978,              
 Monsignor Meyer served as associate director   
 and then director of the Archdiocese of St.    
 Louis' CYC. The CYC offers sports, Scouting    
 and other youth programs. More precisely,      
 in 1960, Fr. Meyer was appointed Director      
 of the Catholic Youth Council, succeeding his  
 friend, and mentor, Msgr. Sullivan. He spent   
 the next 18 years building the Catholic Youth  
 Council's activities and programs for youth.   
 Monsignor Meyer has been around, while         
 `stationed' at Epiphany, to watch Mike         
 Shannon, future Cardinals broadcaster, who     
 he describes, "As a normal kid with exceptional
 athletic ability," and Mayor Francis Slay grow 
 up in the Southside Parish. Both men grew      
 up playing sports with the CYC, which today    
 is the largest youth sports organization in St.
 Louis. The CYC had nearly 5,000 teams          
 playing sports during 2008; and                
       WHEREAS, perhaps no one in the rich      
 tradition of St. Louis University men's soccer 
 had a greater impact than Monsignor Meyer.     
 He played a key role in getting the program    
 started in the late 1950s as a member of a     
 committee that convinced, then SLU president   
Paul Reinart, to start an NCAA men's soccer      
program. Monsignor Meyer maintained his          
association with the sport, and with SLU; and    
      WHEREAS, Monsignor Meyer is a              
member of the St. Louis Soccer Hall of Fame,     
St. Louis Amateur Baseball Hall of Fame, the     
Missouri Athletic Club Hall of Fame, the St.     
Louis University Sports Hall of Fame, and        
has been nominated for the Missouri Sports       
Hall of Fame; and                                
      WHEREAS, The Faithful Steward --           
of the St. Louis Archdiocesan Catholic Youth     
Council; The St. Mary Magdalen Teen-town;        
The St. Mary Magdalen Credit Union; The          
St. Louis International Airport multi-faith      
Chapel and charter chaplain; The St. Mary        
Magdalen Scholarship for Kids; The Camp          
Don Bosco and Rosary Villa - Summer Camps        
for the Youth of the St. Louis Area. Confessor   
/ Counselor to the Sisters of Carondelet; the    
Quiet Philanthropist of many college-bound-      
cash-strapped students from the South City       
Deanery. The South-City friend, if not savior,   
of the North-City Holy Trinity parish who        
individually spearheaded the collection of over  
10,000 cases of groceries for this inner city    
parish during his tenure as the `shepherd' of    
St. Mary Magdalen at Bancroft and                
Kingshighway; and                                
      WHEREAS, the past plus six decades,        
throughout this great Archdiocesan               
cornucopia, has been filled with the blessings   
of fruitful fields for many Christians touched   
by this Man of God. We are prone to forget       
the true source of these bounties, which are     
so constantly enjoyed, come from the ever        
watchful providence of Almighty God. No          
human counsel hath devised, nor hath any         
mortal hand worked out these great things;       
these blessings are truly the gracious gifts of  
the Most High God.                               
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
RESOLVED BY the Board of Aldermen of             
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

the City of St. Louis and we further direct the  
Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this     
Resolution across the minutes of these

            Resolution No. 133                    
  The 100th Anniversary of Emmanuel               
        Missionary Baptist Church                 
      WHEREAS, the congregation of                
 Emmanuel Missionary Baptist Church has a         
 century old history, where there lies sacrifices 
 and accomplishments of a great many warriors.    
 Their journey started as the First Baptist       
 Church of Benton in Benton, Missouri; and        
       WHEREAS, the legacy of Pastors are         
 many, starting with their first Pastor being     
 unknown. During the period of 1909-1932,         
 Reverend Bennett and Reverend Oliver were        
 in office. The exact length of their individual  
 service is unknown. As the congregation grew,    
 they were compelled to find a larger building,   
which led them to 2136 O'Fallon Street in St.     
Louis, Missouri, with Reverend H.H. Davis         
as Pastor for a short time; subsequently          
Reverend P.J. Suggs was called; and               
      WHEREAS, in 1933, First Baptist             
Church moved to 1313 N. Jefferson Avenue          
under the leadership of Reverend L.C. Turner.     
At that time, the church name was changed to      
"Emmanuel" meaning "God with Us." Under           
his leadership, a great work was done; and        
      WHEREAS, in 1934, Reverend H.H.             
Davis returned as Pastor again and served until   
1936 when he resigned and relocated. EMBC         
went into prayer. Their prayers were answered     
in 1937 when Ervin Little was called as Pastor.   
That same year, EMBC moved to 2433                
Dickson Avenue, where Reverend Little served      
until his health began to fail and resigned in    
November 1956; and                                
     WHEREAS, on November 14, 1956,               
Reverend David Brooks became their Pastor         
and under his leadership, the congregation        
began to grow. However, on October 20, 1957,      
the Lord called him home. Later, one of their     
own, Reverend L.V. Washington was called as       
Pastor. In 1958, the church moved from 2735       
Thomas Street to 1385 Goodfellow                  
Boulevard, where they were blessed with a         
number of auxiliaries, such as Junior Choir,      
Celestial Choir and Usher Board; and              
     WHEREAS, once again, one of their            
own, Revered David Dorsey was elected as          
Pastor on March 5, 1973. Under his direction,     
they were blessed to burn the mortgage,           
complete construction of the annex, finish the    
kitchen, get new musical instruments, form        
the Health Unit, male chorus, kitchen             
committee and many other offices were             
formed. But most of all, he added leaders to      
the congregation and Sister Irene Menz            
became the church historian; and                  
     WHEREAS, on November 22, 2002,               
God prevailed and assigned Reverend Duane         
E. Belford as their Pastor, with the divine task  
of a more spiritual and energetic ministry,       
where the young, as well as, the old would        
come together in service to Christ; and           
       WHEREAS, since the organization of         
EMBC, they have become proud of their             
edifice. Though they have had many trials         
and tribulations, they have come this far by      
faith.                                            
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.

 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than

 work pursuant to a contract executed between     
 the successful bidder and the City must be       
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage

 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.  
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage         
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration        
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration 
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.

 the contract provisions related to the Living    
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and

 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any         
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).
