          Clean Energy Initiative                  
       WHEREAS, Proposition C, otherwise           
 known as the Missouri Clean Energy Initiative     
 will be voted on as part of the November ballot;  
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, the Clean Energy Initiative        
 will provide cleaner and cheaper energy to the    
 citizens of the City of St. Louis and the state   
 of Missouri; and                                  
       WHEREAS, heavy reliance on a single         
 source of energy can destabilize the economy      
 and lead to vulnerability and price spikes that   
 result from a volatile energy market; and         
      WHEREAS, rising natural gas and              
 electricity prices are making energy              
 conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable    
 power production much more compelling and         
 economically viable in the City of St. Louis,     
 the state of Missouri and across the country;      
 and                                                
       WHEREAS, a more diverse energy               
 portfolio could help bring about greater energy    
 security and less reliance on foreign energy;      
 and                                                
      WHEREAS, developing sources of                
 renewable energy for use throughout the City       
 of St. Louis, the state of Missouri and our        
 nation would not only make us less reliant on      
 foreign sources of energy but would also           
 increase economic opportunity; and                 
        WHEREAS, the Clean Energy Initiative        
 is an important step toward energy                 
 independence for our state, requiring              
 Missouri's three investor-owned electric           
 utilities to obtain 15 percent of their electricity
 from renewable sources by 2021; and                
       WHEREAS, the Clean Energy Initiative         
 encourages the use of clean sources of             
 electricity like wind, sun and water, reduces      
 the amount of pollution emitted into our air       
 and protects our health and environment for        
 future generations; and                            
       WHEREAS, the Clean Energy Initiative         
 includes the strongest ratepayer protection in     
 the country protecting the citizens of the City    
 of St. Louis and the state of Missouri from        
 unjust rate increases on their electric bills; and 
      WHEREAS, the Clean Energy Initiative,         
 reduces actual customer rates for a total          
 savings of $331 million dollars for ratepayers     
 over a 20-year period.                             
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis that we support              
 Proposition C, the Missouri Clean Energy           
 Initiative as a positive step towards energy       
 independence for the City of St. Louis, the        
 citizens of Missouri and the entire country        
 and we further direct the Clerk of this Board
