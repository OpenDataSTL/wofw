           OF RESOLUTIONS                      
     Mr. Bosley introduced Resolution No.      
 6 and requested that it be assigned to the    
 Committee on Housing, Urban Development       
 & Zoning for hearing.                         
            Resolution No. 6                   
      WHEREAS, each year millions of           
 taxpayer dollars are appropriated for various 
 projects and organizations through the Federal
 Block Grant program administered by the       
 Community Development Administration;         
 and                                           
       WHEREAS, these funds are                
 appropriated by this Board of Aldermen by     
 ordinance and are intended to assist in the   
 stabilization and development of this City's  
 neighborhoods and the improvement in the      
 quality of life for our citizens; and         
      WHEREAS, Block Grant funds are held      
 by the Community Development                  
 Administration and transferred to programs    
 and community based organizations under the   
 terms of contracts which all recipients are   
 required to execute; and                      
     WHEREAS, common business practices        
 would suggest that while these funds are being
 held by the Community Development             
 Administration they are accruing interest; and
      WHEREAS, such interest would not         
 have been considered in the annual            
 appropriation ordinance and therefore,        
 presumably, is still held by the Community    
 Development Administration;                   
       WHEREAS , any interest earned from      
 the millions of Block Grant dollars provided  
 to the City of St. Louis should be accounted  
 for and properly appropriated to programs     
 and organizations within the city wards where 
 the original grants were awarded;             
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                      
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of          
 the City of St. Louis that we request a full  
 accounting by the Director of the Community   
 Development Administration to the             
 appropriate committee of this Board for the   
 following purposes:                           
 *    to determine how much interest has been  
 earned from the Federal Block Grant program   
 since the inception of such program;          
 *     to determine where this money is being  
 held;                                         
 *    to ascertain why this money has not      
 been appropriated for use in the past;        
 *    to determine how much of this            
 unaccounted for interest is now available for 
 use in each of the city's wards;              
      We further authorize the appropriate        
committee of this board to conduct hearings       
for the purpose of analyzing the accounting       
information provided by the Director of the       
Community Development Administration              
and to make recommendations to the full board     
as such committee deems reasonable. This          
committee is authorized to issue subpoenas,       
as necessary, to require the production of        
documents or the attendance of witnesses.
