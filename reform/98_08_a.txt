ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                             
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part                
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.        
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu                  
 thereof is the following new section.              
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                   
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time     
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the       
 presence of such bidders as desire to be           
 present, and shall be open to the inspection       
 of bidders.                                        
       B. The bids shall not be materially          
 modified or amended as to price, specification     
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon,    
 after opening except when the lowest bid is        
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid       
 is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder       
 within two percent of the lowest bid may           
 match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches    
 the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner       
 may select the bid from the local bidder. If       
 more than one local bidder is within two           
 percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest    
 local bidder may match the bid. In all other       
 circumstances, modification, supplementation       
 or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.     
 For purposes of this chapter, local bidder         
 means a bidder whose principal place of            
 business is within the City of St. Louis, has      
 had a valid business license for at least one      
 year, and is current in payment of local taxes.    
 Principal place of business shall be defined as    
 the business's physical office, plant, or site     
 where a majority (51%) of the full-time            
 employees, chief officer, and managers of the      
 business regularly work and conduct business,      
 or where the plant or office and equipment         
 required for the furnishing of the goods or        
 performance of the services provided to the        
 City, as required by the contract, are physically  
 located in the City of St. Louis for at least one  
 taxable year immediately prior to the date of      
 the bid.                                           
       C. Bids may be for one or more or all the    
 articles advertised for, but there shall be a      
 specific bid on each article. The award may be     
 made to the lowest bidder for any article, or      
 to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition    
 or any part thereof, but the Board of              
 Standardization may reject any or all bids or      
 any part of any bid.                               
      SECTION THREE. Severability.                  
       The provisions of this section are           
 severable. If any provision of this ordinance      
 is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not     
 affect other provisions of the ordinance which     
 can be given effect without the invalid            
 provision.
