            Resolution No. 149                      
       WHEREAS, in response to a Petition           
 for a Writ of Mandamus filed in the Twenty-        
 Second Judicial Circuit in the City of St. Louis,  
 a Circuit Judge ordered St. Louis Fire             
 Department Chief Sherman George to make            
 certain promotions within the Fire                 
 Department; and                                    
      WHEREAS, the court order was based            
 on the theory that an appointing authority         
 within the civil service system must fill an       
 employment vacancy if there is a certified list    
 of qualified applicants and the appointing         
 authority requests a copy of such list; and        
      WHEREAS, this order could be                  
 interpreted to mean that all civil service         
 vacancies must be filled if there is a list of     
 qualified applicants; and                          
      WHEREAS, such a result would have             
 an immediate and adverse effect on the city        
 budget; and                                        
      WHEREAS, it is imperative that this           
 circuit court order be reviewed closely by the     
 Missouri Court of Appeals and possibly the         
 Missouri Supreme Court in order to clarify         
 the City's hiring responsibilities under Chapter   
 18 of the City Charter;                            
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis, that we encourage the       
 office of the City Counselor to join with Chief    
 Sherman George in his legal appeal of this         
 court order to the Missouri Court of Appeals       
 and we further support any effort to clarify       
 the hiring responsibilities imposed on the         
 Department of Personnel by the City Charter.

            Resolution No. 230                    
      WHEREAS, Missouri's Historic                
 Preservation Tax Credit is designed to create    
incentives for redevelopment and business              
growth in both urban and rural communities             
by providing state tax credits for these               
purposes; and                                          
     WHEREAS, the State of Missouri                    
Historic Tax Credit is the national model for          
rehabilitation and community revitalization;           
and                                                    
     WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis is                 
beginning to stem the tide of lost population

our city over the past four decades; and               
     WHEREAS, eliminating or capping this              
program would have a devastating impact on             
the building renaissance that has transformed          
Downtown and revitalized many of our                   
neighborhoods; and                                     
     WHEREAS, with the State's current                 
budget problems tampering with these tax               
credit programs will undoubtedly be                    
considered by some lawmakers;                          
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                              
RESOLVED that the St. Louis Board of

 work pursuant to a contract executed between    
 the successful bidder and the City must be      
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage    
 rates and if rates are adjusted during term of  
 the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made. 
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage        
 Acknowledgment            and     Acceptance    
 Declaration" with the bid. Failure to submit    
 this Declaration with the bid will result in    
 rejection of the bid. A successful bidder's     
 failure to comply with the contract provisions  
 related to the Living Wage Ordinance may        
 result in termination of the contract and the   
 imposition of additional penalties as set for in
 the Ordinance and Regulations.
