           Resolution No. 329                    
            William Rhone, Jr.                   
       WHEREAS, William Rhone, Jr.,              
 affectionately known as Junior, was born on     
 May 10, 1941 in St. Louis, Missouri to the      
 union of William and Bernice Rhone, both who    
 preceded him in death. He was also preceded     
 in death by his oldest sister, Delores Williams 
 and his youngest sister, Jardell Bass; and      
      WHEREAS, Junior and Hilda Robinson         
 were joined in holy matrimony and to this       
 union three sons were born. Through life        
 experiences and personal sacrifices, he         
 provided his sons with a strong sense of family 
 and responsibility, which helped to establish   
 true Rhone Manhood; and                         
      WHEREAS, he was educated in both           
 the Archdiocese of St. Louis and the St. Louis  
 Public School System. His employment began      
 at the age of 12 where he became an             
 experienced butcher. After years with General   
 Motors, he was employed with Bi-State           
 Development Agency where he retired after       
 many years of service. After retirement,        
 Junior's favorite pastime became sleeping all   
 day and staying up all night eating and         
 watching Westerns with his dedicated and        
 devoted wife and movie partner, Hilda; and      
      WHEREAS, Junior enjoyed hanging            
 with his "boys" at Buck's Barbershop talking    
 about sports and old times. Everyone he came    
 in contact with knew about the                  
accomplishments of his sons and family. His        
love for his grandsons was felt by all and he      
beamed with pride when he spoke of them.           
His hearty laugh and broad smile is one that       
will remain in the memories of his friends and     
family forever; and                                
      WHEREAS, he will be remembered by            
his loving wife of 48 years, Hilda; his three      
sons Jeffrey Anthony, William III, and Eric        
Charles (Angela); six grandsons-William IV,        
James, Exccle, Eric II, Arlington, and Eldridge;   
and Stephon Adams; one sister-in-law, seven        
brother-in-laws, nine nieces, seven nephews,       
five great nieces, 11 great nephews, seven great   
great nieces and nephews, and a host of other      
relatives and friends.

           Resolution No. 331                      
            Rodney Winfield                        
     WHEREAS, we pause in our                      
deliberations to note the untimely passing of      
St. Louis native and world famous comedian,        
Rodney Winfield; and                               
      WHEREAS, Rodney Winfield, whose              
name was often mentioned in the company of         
legends like Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor,          
died at age 76, reportedly due to kidney failure;  
and                                                
     WHEREAS, Mr. Winfield started doing           
comedy in the mid 1970's when comedians            
could get work mainly opening up for musical       
 acts. Mr. Winfield opened for the legendary        
 Temptations, The O'Jays; and                       
      WHEREAS, he was one of the original           
 tour members for the first Def Jam Comedy          
 Tour; and                                          
      WHEREAS, he landed a movie role in            
 the 1991 indie film, Talkin' Dirty After Dark.     
 He pretty much played himself - a frank, fun-      
 loving, sharp-tongued standup comic,               
 alongside Martin Lawrence and John                 
 Witherspoon; and                                   
       WHEREAS, in the film, Mr. Winfield           
 made his already popular joke about an "ugly       
 person" even more widely known: "If you            
 follow an ugly person home, an ugly person         
 is going to open the door," he joked in a kitchen  
 scene. Mr. Winfield thus insured his legacy        
 will live on in one of the most recycled jokes     
 in comedy; and                                     
       WHEREAS, Mr. Winfield also landed a          
 role alongside Chris Tucker and Lorenz Tate        
 in the 1995 cult classic Dead Presidents, and      
 he voiced Card Player #3 in late comedian-         
 actor Robin Harris' hit cartoon film Bebe's        
 Kids in 1992.                                      
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to             
 remember the many contributions of Rodney          
 Winfield to the citizens of the City of St. Louis  
 and we join with his many friends in               
 expressing our sorrow at his passing, and we       
 further direct the Clerk of this Board to spread   
 a copy of this Resolution across the minutes       
 of these proceedings and to prepare a memorial     
 copy for presentation to the family, at a time     
 and place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
