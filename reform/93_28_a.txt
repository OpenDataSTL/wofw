      James Prentice McFadden                    
      WHEREAS, we pause in our                   
deliberations to note the untimely passing of    
longtime St. Louis resident, James Prentice      
McFadden; and                                    
      WHEREAS, James Prentice McFadden           
made his arrival as the second of two children   
born to James and Myrtle (Williams)              
McFadden on October 30, 1928. He was born        
in Jackson, Tennessee and moved to St. Louis,    
at the age of two. James graduated from          
Washington Technical High School and then        
went on to a business college where he received  
a certificate of completion; and                 
     WHEREAS, James accepted Christ at           
an early age. Over his lifetime he attended      
some of the local churches, but his favorite     
and truly his home church was Union              
Memorial. He loved everything about the          
church and the people and the Pastors were       
truly a family to him. His membership            
spanned decades. He talked about the Pastors     
he was under and how he could feel the love      
of Christ through them. Notably he spoke         
recently of Dr. Doggett and Pastor Kosh. He      
really felt a connection with them and           
experienced the presence of God through their    
teachings; and                                   
      WHEREAS, James enlisted in the

in Holy Matrimony with Josephine Walker          
to this union one child was born. Their son,     
Darryl, made him very proud and he was the       
spitting image of him. Josephine brought a       
daughter to this relationship, Yvette, and       
James was very fond of her and thought of        
her like his own; and                            
     WHEREAS, James, or as most people           
called him Jim, was a true businessman. He       
was known to start up businesses and have        
success with them at a young age. He started     
a small paper route which grew to much larger    
proportions, so much so that he hired some       
friends to help him with getting the             
newspapers out. James started the Nor-Side       
TV Shop in 1960, while driving buses for Bi-     
State Development. He loved driving buses        
and repairing televisions. He had a special      
friend who worked for him; Freeman Bosley,       
Sr. and they got along great and loved the       
business. He later started the McFadden          
Realty and Insurance Company which is still      
in existence today. He has sold real estate to   
some of the most notable people around St.       
Louis. He has sold insurance for companies       
such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, Travelers and    
various small companies. As recently as three    
years ago, GEICO offered him a position as a     
regional manager but James wanted to sit back    
and relax by this time and just enjoy life;      
GEICO made this offer to him three times in      
 the past seven years; and                         
       WHEREAS, later in life James met and        
 married Georgia Harrison and the two of them      
 shared twelve exciting years together. James      
 leaves to cherish his memory his devoted wife,    
 Georgia; a loving son Darryl (Ana) McFadden       
 of Fort Worth, Texas; a devoted and loving        
 daughter, Barbara (Drew) Nelson; three            
 step-daughters,Yvette (Melvin), Katherine         
 (Tommie) and Trina all of St. Louis. He has       
 three wonderful grandchildren to carry on his     
 legacy, Mya Easaw, Katrina and Kalen              
 McFadden and many cousins and friends. He         
 was preceded in death by his parents and          
 sister, Rose Lee Price. Also some friends who     
 deserve special mention are Arthur Matthews,      
 Sam Nichols and James Cole and the many           
 co-workers of Hertz Car Rental.

at a rate in increments of one-eighth of one          
percent up to a maximum of one percent on             
the receipts from the sale at retail of all tangible  
personal property or taxable services at retail       
within the District, if such property and             
services are subject to taxation by the State of      
Missouri pursuant to the provisions of                
Sections 144.010 to 144.525 of the Revised

Act, the board of directors of the proposed           
district will be requested to adopt a resolution      
imposing such Sales Tax at a rate not to exceed       
one percent (1.0%) and will request that the          
Sales Tax be submitted to the qualified voters        
for approval. By unanimous petition of the            
owners of all property within the District,           
the owners shall provide their unanimous              
consent and approval with respect to whether          
the District shall impose a sales tax within the      
District at the rate of up to one percent (1.0%)      
for up to 40 years. The Petitioners desire to         
seek voter approval of the imposition of the          
TDD Sales Tax at a rate not to exceed one             
percent (1.0%), to (i) pay costs of financing         
or refinancing the Transportation Project, (ii)

the TDD Act to fund the costs of financing or         
refinancing the Transportation Project, and           
 (iv) to pledge such TDD Sales Tax to the City       
 of St. Louis, Missouri (or an authority located     
 within the City of St. Louis, Missouri with         
 the power to issue obligations) for the             
 repayment of obligations issued with respect        
 to the redevelopment of the real property           
 located within the District, at least a portion     
 of which shall be issued on behalf of the District  
 with respect to the Transportation Project.         
      20. The proposed District will not be          
 an undue burden on any owner of property            
 within the District and is not unjust or            
 unreasonable.                                       
      21. The District's proposed budgeted

 Section 238.275 of the TDD Act.                     
       23. In no event shall the Sales Tax be        
 repealed, in whole or in part, nor the District     
 be dissolved, until payment in full and             
 satisfaction of all transportation development      
 revenue bonds, transportation development
