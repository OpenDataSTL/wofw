          Resolution No. 306                      
     Friendly Temple Missionary                   
 Baptist Church Dome Renovation                   
     WHEREAS, Friendly Temple                     
Missionary Baptist Church is led by Pastor        
Michael Jones where the mission is to             
passionately pursue the work of proclaiming       
the Good News of Jesus Christ and to serve,       
through the Gospel, as a vessel for effecting     
positive change within the people and             
communities they touch; and                       
      WHEREAS, the Friendly Temple                
Missionary Baptist Church firmly believes         
in the rebirthing power of the Gospel to renew    
hearts, restore perspectives, and revive          
possibilities, all of which will be reflected in  
the resurrected lives of each individual; and     
      WHEREAS, Friendly Temple                    
Missionary Baptist Church purchased the           
"Dome" on May 15, 1998, which was a               
vacant, dilapidated building that had pigeons     
and mice occupying its surroundings. Pastor       
Jones had a vision to renovate this abandoned     
and forgotten building and create a Family Life   
Center to include an educational wing,            
gymnasium, and large multi-purpose room that      
is now called the "Dome." Due to the              
tremendous and rapid growth at Friendly           
Temple, the church officially moved to the        
Dome after the renovation was completed and       
that became the new worship space. Not long       
after that, the church outgrew the Dome and       
moved to the Main Sanctuary in 2010 where         
worship is hosted today; and                      
      WHEREAS, the roof of the Dome               
endured major damage in February 2011 due         
to the Spring Storm leaving the Dome space        
unable to be utilized since the incident          
occurred. The inability to utilize the facility   
created a considerable inconvenience while        
restricting regularly scheduled services and      
limiting contracted rental agreements; and        
      WHEREAS, Friendly Temple                    
Missionary Baptist Church has implemented         
a successful campaign allowing major              
renovations of the Dome to include 3 new          
multipurpose rooms, an expanded stage with        
wood flooring, new stage and auditorium           
lighting, stage curtains, restoration of the      
 ceiling, new entry and exits with expanded        
 corridors, new restrooms, and new video and       
 sound systems; and

           Resolution No. 307                      
 Gwendolyn Marie Warfield Thompson                 
       WHEREAS, we pause to honor                  
 Gwendolyn Marie Warfield Thompson on the          
 occasion of her Retirement Celebration for        
 more than 50 years of dedication and service      
 in music ministry and for a lifetime of           
 outstanding achievements as a musician, public    
 school teacher, wife, mother and friend; and      
       WHEREAS, Gwendolyn Marie                    
 Warfield Thompson was born into a God-            
 fearing home to the union of the late Rev. Edgar  
 Warfield and Jessie Warfield. She is the          
 product of a very spiritual upbringing and was    
 trained and taught well, both religiously and     
 philosophically; and                              
      WHEREAS, Gwendolyn Thompson is               
 a devoted wife to Harold Lawrence                 
 Thompson. She is a loving and devoted mother      
 to Kimberly Henderson and Danita                  
 Mumphard; mother-in-law to John                   
 Henderson and Robert Mumphard Jr.;                
 grandmother to Mylan Henderson, Ryan              
 Henderson, Kellen Henderson, Robert               
 Mumphard III, Jared Mumphard and Amarria          
 Mumphard; Godmother to Sharon Brown,              
 Beatrice Jackson, Marcel Mayes, LaRon Ivy         
 and Glenda Munson; and aunt to many nieces        
 and nephews; and                                  
       WHEREAS, Gwendolyn's foundation             
 and roots lie deeply in the First Free Will       
 Baptist Church under the inspirational            
 leadership of her father the late, Rev. Edgar     
 Warfield. When Gwendolyn was three years          
 old, her mother noticed that Gwendolyn would      
 go to the piano and play songs by ear. As      
 Gwendolyn grew older, her mother, a piano      
 teacher, knew that she had a musical gift.     
 However, she did not want her to only play     
 by ear; she required that she learn how to read
 music. It is a good thing that Gwendolyn had   
 a praying, insistent mother because music has  
 been a part of her life all of her life; and   
       WHEREAS, Gwendolyn Thompson              
 has been a faithful member of the First Free   
 Will Baptist Church for over 60 years.         
 Gwendolyn at age 14 began to play at the       
 First Free Will Baptist Church for the Junior  
 Mission choir. At age 15, Gwendolyn was        
 asked to play at Union Tabernacle Missionary   
 Baptist Church. Her father agreed that she     
 could play on every Sunday except the 3rd      
 Sunday so that she could play at First Free    
 Will Baptist Church for the youth, which       
 included the Junior Mission and the            
 Warfieldites. Her music job at Union           
 Tabernacle lasted three years, after which time
 Rev. Warfield asked his daughter to return to  
 First Free Will full time. She later became the
 minister of music at the church; and           
       WHEREAS, Gwendolyn attended the          
 St. Louis Public Schools, graduating from      
 Soldan High School in 31/2 years. She played   
 for the choir at Soldan and attended           
 accelerated high school music students'        
 classes at Washington University. She was also 
 a member of the Crescendos, a youth division   
 of the St. Louis Music Association. Also, for  
 two summers, during her high school years,     
 Gwendolyn taught music at Girl Scout camps.    
 She attended Harris Teachers' College and      
 earned a degree in education. In 1963, she     
 began her teaching career as a third-grade     
 teacher at Farragut School. Later, as a music  
 teacher in the Sumner-Beaumont district of     
 St. Louis Public Schools, she taught at several
 elementary schools, among them Ashland,        
 Lexington, Gundlach, Turner Middle, Cote       
 Brilliante, Stevens, Simmons, Clark, Mark      
 Twain and Hempstead. Gwendolyn retired in      
 2000; and                                      
      WHEREAS, Gwendolyn is a member            
 of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and was the      
 accompanist for the sorority's Gamma Omega     
 Singers. She was a member of the Walton        
 Choraliers. She also accompanied her           
 daughter, Danita, on several songs on her CD   
 projects. She has written songs, including     
 "Agape Love," and recorded several albums.     
 Gwendolyn has also been the minister of        
 music at West Presbyterian Church; and         
       WHEREAS, Gwendolyn and her               
 husband love to travel and have been blessed   
 to be able to go around the world. They have   
 traveled to all 50 United States, Canada,      
 Mexico, and many countries on the continents   
of South America, Asia, Africa, Europe and         
Australia. Gwendolyn has two hobbies:              
gardening and photography. Further, she            
assists her daughter, Kimberly, in her             
LiveLines Editing business, as a co-editor of      
books and written literature. Gwendolyn's          
favorite reminder is: "Keep smiling and let        
nothing steal your joy!"                           
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

Warfield Thompson for her many                     
accomplishments and we wish her peace and          
happiness in her retirement and we further         
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy    
of this Resolution across the minutes of these     
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative         
copy to the end that it may be presented to

            Resolution No. 309                         
         Officer Paul Simmons                          
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that              
 Officer Paul Simmons has been named the               
 2011 District Three Officer of the Year; and          
       WHEREAS, Officer Paul Simmons was               
 the recipient of the Third District Officer of        
 the Month Award four (4) times in 2011, in            
 March, April, July and August; and                    
       WHEREAS, Officer Paul Simmons                   
 wrote 128 very thorough police reports, made          
 58 arrests and issued 276 charges in 2011; and        
       WHEREAS, Officer Paul Simmons has               
 displayed exceptional initiative and                  
 productivity not only with his high number            
 of arrests, but most of his arrests have been         
 from original cases, where he takes the time to       
 conduct investigations in order to clear his          
 cases and writes clear, concise reports, instead      
 of just entering "wanteds" for district               
 detectives to "clear". This has resulted in           
 getting guns, drugs and criminal suspects off         
 our streets; and                                      
       WHEREAS, in March 2011 Officer                  
 Paul Simmons effected several outstanding             
 drug-related arrests, and in total arrested 15        
 individuals, resulting in 56 charges being issued     
 against the suspects. In July 2011 Officer Paul       
 Simmons conducted an extensive investigation          
 following a flourishing of a weapon incident          
 and recovered a revolver, and in total                
 accomplished 6 arrests, resulting in 16 charges       
 being issued against the suspects - all in 13         
 days, because he was on vacation the rest of          
 the month. In September 2011 Officer Paul             
 Simmons, responding to a burglar alarm call,          
 saw two subjects running from the scene, and          
 arrested one of them. After an extensive              
 investigation, he located the second suspect          
 at his place of employment, made an arrest,           
 recovered all of the items stolen from the            
 home, and obtained warrants from the Circuit          
 Attorney's Office for Burglary 1st and Stealing     
 over $500.                                          
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 achievements of Officer Paul Simmons. We            
 commend his initiative, thorough                    
 investigation, productivity and extraordinary       
 performance. We salute him for a job well           
 done. We further direct the Clerk of this Board     
 of Aldermen to spread this Resolution across        
 the Minutes of these proceedings and to             
 prepare a commemorative copy to the end             
 that it might be presented by the sponsors to
