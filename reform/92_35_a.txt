 of five women, led by Ella Brooks Thompson

 Church. In 1905 this fledgling church          
 purchased a building on Morgan Street and      
 was renamed "Morgan Street Christian           
 Church." In 1910, the church moved to 4322

 ten years; and

 Lucky. This was possible through a $10,000     
 gift from the Christian Women's Board of       
 Missions. The name Centennial Christian

 Christian Church moved to its present          
 location, 4950 Fountain Avenue. The city's     
 first interracial nursery was located in the   
 church. The Pastor and members participated    
 in numerous religious and civic organizations, 
 thus achieving local, state and national       
 recognition; and                               
       WHEREAS, Centennial Christian

Honorable Terry Kennedy,Alderman 18th Ward        
            Resolution No. 195                      
     The 100th Anniversary of the                   
     Holy Trinity Serbian Eastern                   
            Orthodox Church                         
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that           
 the Holy Trinity Serbian Eastern Orthodox          
 Church is celebrating its 100 year anniversary;    
 and                                                
       WHEREAS, in the late 1880's, the St.         
 Louis Serbs lived in three separate enclaves       
 according to the provinces from which they         
 had come: one group on North Broadway,             
 the second on Chouteau Avenue, and the third       
 in the southern part of the city; and              
      WHEREAS, the idea and movement for            
 establishing a church-school congregation as a     
 need originated in the ranks of the then existing  
 singing society "Gusle" which was organized        
 in 1908. The all-Serbian meeting was held          
 August 1, 1909. The assembly voted                 
 unanimously to form a congregation under the       
 name "Serbian Eastern Orthodox Church-             
 School Congregation `Holy Trinity' of St.          
 Louis, Missouri;" and                              
       WHEREAS, the first concern of the            
 newly organized congregation was the opening       
 of a Serbian school and the purchasing of a        
 building. At the following meeting a special       
 committee reported the purchase of a building      
 on the corner of 8th and Barry Street. On          
 March 10, 1912, the St. Louis congregation         
 selected Milutin Jankovich from Cincinnati         
 as their first parish priest. Father Jankovich     
 served his first service in the hall on Palm       
 Sunday, March 31, 1912; and                        
      WHEREAS, on April 25, 1926 a general          
 meeting was held at which was unanimously          
 decided to build a church and to proceed with      
 fund-raising at once. The most suitable            
 location was at Geyer and McNair. The              
 ground was dedicated on October 23, 1927           
 and the cornerstone laid on June 2, 1928; and      
       WHEREAS, with the outbreak of World          
 War II the St. Louis Serbian community rallied     
 to its patriotic duty by sending over 160          
 members to serve in the armed forces of our        
 country. The various church organizations          
 participated actively in many patriotic            
 programs, benefits and drives, selling             
 approximately $150,000.00 in War Bonds. In         
 1949 the first group of Serbian refugees from      
 Europe began to arrive in St. Louis. A special     
 committee, with the priest as chairman, was        
 organized to receive and find employment for       
 the new arrivals. The group completed this         
 patriotic and humane mission with great            
 understanding and kindness and helped              
 approximately 10,000 Serbs to come to this         
 country in the years 1949-1951; and                
      WHEREAS, due to a shrinking and aging         
 membership, Holy Trinity began looking for          
 a new and innovative ways to financially            
 sustain it. The two largest ventures answering      
 to that need included the establishment of a        
 yearly festival, affectionately called              
 "SerbFest" and the church also began catering       
 services which has helped to financially            
 support the parish. The St. Louis Holy              
 Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church-School              
 Congregation, as it moves into the 21st             
 century, will be led by and congregated with        
 the great grandchildren, grandchildren and          
 children of the men and women who, through          
 the love for their Orthodoxy and Serbian            
 heritage, decided to form a "spiritual home"        
 for themselves 100 years ago.                       
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                            
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 Anniversary of the Holy Trinity Serbian             
 Eastern Orthodox Church and we direct the

      WHEREAS, student enrollment on the        
 Forest Park campus has increased this fall,

      WHEREAS, children of these students         
are receiving qualitative early childhood         
education from Forest Park's accredited center    
with trained professionals, many of them will     
be placed in the throes of unsafe, unhealthy      
and poor educational services and become          
more deprived and disadvantaged, which            
combined will negatively impact our city and      
society; and

Community College continue to provide             
current support services offered to help our      
young women and their children in their           
pursuit of mandates that will aid them in

of these critical services at any site.
