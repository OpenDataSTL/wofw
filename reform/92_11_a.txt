          Elder Samuel Moore                       
      WHEREAS, Samuel Moore was born               
January 18, 1924 in Palestine, Arkansas. As a      
young boy, Samuel was prayed for by St.            
Samuel, an early pioneer in the church. St.        
Samuel prophesied that Samuel Moore would          
be a great man of God; and                         
      WHEREAS, in 1943, Samuel Moore               
married a beautiful young woman named              
Elizabeth Allmon. Years later, in order to better  
provide for his growing family, Samuel Moore       
enlisted in the Army. After serving in the Army    
during World War II, he was honorably              
discharged. In 1953, at the age of 29 he           
attended Arkansas Trade College and learned        
the art of bricklaying; and                        
      WHEREAS, in 1949, Samuel Moore               
accepted the Lord Jesus Christ into his life       
and attended Williams Temple COGIC under           
the leadership of Bishop Columbus Williams.        
He was active in the church auxiliaries - the      
Brotherhood Quartet, Sunday School,                
Y.P.W.W, when he was called by God to preach       
and the Evangelist Department. Elder Samuel        
Moore's first message was preached at Bishop       
Phillips Church; and                               
      WHEREAS, in 1955, he moved his               
family from Arkansas to St. Louis and was          
one of the first union, black bricklayers to       
work on the downtown Plazas Square                 
Apartments. After a 15 year career as a union      
bricklayer, he started Moore's Construction        
Company and worked there for 30 years.             
Between 1989 and 1992, he was a bricklaying        
instructor at Ranken Technical College and         
was instrumental in building the set of brick      
columns at the entry of the college, which still   
stand today; and                                   
      WHEREAS, in 1963, Elder Moore was            
led by God to found Samuel Temple Church           
of God in Christ (originally Moore's Temple).      
Many family, friends, and other supporters         
contributed to the success and growth of the       
church. Samuel Temple eventually relocated         
and was renamed St. Samuel Temple, which           
in actuality St. Samuel Temple was supposed        
 to be the original name; and                     
      WHEREAS, forty-three years later at         
 82 years of age, Elder Samuel Moore was still    
 preaching the Word of God with power and         
 authority. He was a great man of God through     
 which many souls were being saved through        
 his ministry. His steps were ordered by the      
 Lord. He's truly a great man of God.             
        NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 rooms in her home and rendered care. Nancy

 remained under the leadership of Elder Charles  
 Williams. The church name was changed to        
 Martins Paradise Temple C.O.G.I.C. Nancy's      
 life was spent in grooming her children to be   
 used in the service of the Lord through prayer, 
 training, teaching, but most of all living a    
 Christian life; and

 arranged each flower bed differently using      
 various arrays of beautiful colors of all types.

 the successful bidder and the City must be

 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.

 the contract provisions related to the Living    
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and

works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
the prevailing rate for any work done under      
the contract by the contractor or by any
