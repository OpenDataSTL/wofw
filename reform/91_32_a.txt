 fills the seats, supports the families, and

 monitoring and implementing a high quality       
 family approach to school readiness and          
 positive child development; and                  
       WHEREAS, Judy is now retiring. Grace       
 Hill is sad to see her go, but her wisdom,       
 judgment and best practices will remain as a     
 model and legend for a long, long time.

 ran the race, Lolo clipped a hurdle, and           
 stumbled, taking a disappointing seventh           
 place, while her other teammate Damu Cherry        
 took a disappointing fourth. However, Dawn         
 Harper surged through, and victoriously            
 became the gold medalist. She claimed she          
 would "shock the world," and aparrently she        
 did. "I just knew I needed to react to the gun,    
 and just you know, head down, and focus on         
 me and be quick and attack each hurdle and         
 then head for the line," said Dawn Harper.         
 Then, she took her victory lap around the          
 track holding the USA flag, winning another        
 gold medal for the USA track and field team.       
 "This is a kid that nobody knew, and now           
 she's the Olympic champion. It's                   
 breathtaking," said Bob Kersee.

           Resolution No. 210                   
          Robbie Montgomery                     
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that       
 on Thursday, October 23, 2008 at the Hyatt     
 Hotel the Metro Sentinel Journal News will     
 convene its 33rd Annual "Yes I Can" awards     
 banquet; and                                   
     WHEREAS, under the leadership of           
 Michael C. Williams, owner and publisher,      
the Metro Sentinel Journal News continues         
to recognize the meaningful contributions of      
stellar St. Louisans; and                         
    WHEREAS, local leaders have been              
nominated by their peers and admirers as          
"Special Achievers" in 2008; and                  
      WHEREAS, these local leaders have           
established themselves as outstanding             
professionals in the public, private, non-        
profit, government and educational sectors;       
and                                               
      WHEREAS, Robbie Montgomery grew             
up the oldest of nine children in a Mississippi   
family that moved to St. Louis when she was       
a child. Money wasn't plentiful, but the          
family always ate well. Montgomery's mother       
fed her family three home-cooked meals a day;     
and                                               
      WHEREAS, after years of singing in          
church and talent shows, Montgomery               
dropped out in the 11th grade in 1958 to sing     
professionally. She soon was singing as an        
"Artette" with Art Lassiter, who was              
supposed to collaborate on a song with Ike        
Turner. When Lassiter and Turner had a falling    
out, Ike went ahead with the project anyway,      
putting the then unknown Anna Mae Bullock         
on lead vocals and Montgomery among those         
on backup. Bullock, whom Montgomery calls         
Little Ann, went on to become Tina Turner;        
and                                               
      WHEREAS, after Montgomery gave              
birth to her first child, Montgomery joined       
Ike and Tina Turner on the road in 1961 as an     
Ikette. By the late 1960s, Montgomery             
stopped touring with the Turners. The Ikettes     
had a hit record of their own, but had to stop    
using the name, which was owned by Ike            
Turner; and                                       
      WHEREAS, Montgomery, who had                
moved to California, toured as a "Night           
Tripper" with Dr. John - of "Right Place,         
Wrong Time" fame - and worked as a session        
singer, recording with Stevie Wonder, Barbra      
Streisand, The Rolling Stones and Joe Cocker.     
During the late 1970s, she opened the short-      
lived Wings and Things, a chicken wing            
restaurant in Pomona, Calif., and continued       
singing until a lung condition failed to heal     
properly, ending her career in 1979; and          
      WHEREAS, Montgomery returned to             
St. Louis and trained as a dialysis technician.   
One of her patients was Leon Strauss; he and      
his wife, Mary, were well-known for their         
involvement with the arts in the city, including  
restoring the opulent Fox Theatre. Leon           
Strauss died in 1999, but the couple supported    
Montgomery's hope to open a restaurant. "We       
just thought it would be a really nice thing to   
help someone with their dream," Mary Strauss      
 recalled. "She's a survivor, and she's got this  
 great frame of mind." Montgomery recalled        
 formidable obstacles. She'd save money when      
 she could, buying equipment slowly at            
 rummage sales or trading musical equipment       
 for it. But the struggle paid off when she was   
 able to open her first Sweetie Pie's. Two years  
 ago, Montgomery opened her second                
 restaurant - Sweetie Pie's at the Mangrove in    
 South St. Louis.                                 
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen for            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 Montgomery for her stellar accomplishments       
 and commitment to making our region a better     
 place to live and work. We direct the Clerk of   
 this Board to prepare a commemorative copy       
 of this resolution to the end that it may be

 and                                              
       WHEREAS, Charlie A. Dooley grew up         
 in St. Louis and attended Clark Elementary in    
 North St. Louis and graduated from Wellston      
 High School. As a very young man he became       
 a mentor by coaching the youth of his North      
 County neighborhood in baseball for a local      
 Police Association. He developed a natural       
 ability as a role model, and his early coaching  
 was soon followed by many more admirable         
 commitments during his lifetime; and             
      WHEREAS, in 1965, he enlisted in the        
 United States Army and was stationed in the      
 Republic of Vietnam in 1966 and 1967. As a       
 Specialist, 5th Class, he received an honorable  
 discharge in 1968. After his military tour of    
 duty, he came home and went to work at           
 McDonnell-Douglas Co. He enjoyed a thirty-       
 year career there before retiring and moving     
 on to a new vocation in public service; and      
       WHEREAS, during the years at               
 McDonnell Douglas, Dooley also became            
 more active in citizen affairs and soon          
 progressed to his current and longstanding       
 incumbency as Committeeman of Normandy           
 Township. From there, he went on to his          
 Mayoral position for the City of Northwoods.     
 While mayor of his hometown, he invested an      
 enormous amount of time into the community       
 at large by serving as President of the Missouri 
 Chapter of Black Mayors, President of the        
 St. Louis County Municipal League, Co-           
 Chair of the Normandy Communities Forum,

 to the Democratic National Convention in 1988    
 and in 2004; and                                 
      WHEREAS, following his extensive            
 responsibilities as mayor of Northwoods,         
 Dooley's career expanded even further when       
 he was elected First District Councilman of      
 St. Louis County. Then in 2003, he was           
 appointed to the position of St. Louis County    
 Executive. He then went on to be elected to      
 the office of County Executive in November       
 of 2004, and reelected in November 2006 by a     
 landslide majority. As County Executive,         
 Dooley now manages a county of one million       
 people and a budget in excess of $500 million.   
 Along with his many duties as County             
 Executive, Dooley is also a member of the        
 East-West Gateway Coordinating Council           
 Board of Directors and oversees the St. Louis    
 County Economic Council; and                     
        WHEREAS, as his responsibilities have     
 grown and expanded, his list of priorities also  
 continues to expand and grow. Included on        
 that list are economic development initiatives   
 such as the almost 600-acre NorthPark            
 Development and the innovative St. Louis         
 County Economic Collaborative, which was         
 created to connect municipalities and the region 
 at large drawing national attention from         
 business leaders and economic development        
 professionals seeking to establish or expand     
 their businesses in St. Louis County . In        
 another collaborative effort, Dooley took part   
 in the first joint meeting between the St. Louis 
 County Council and the St. Charles County        
 Council. The two councils agreed to meet         
 regularly in an effort to work together on issues
 of regional importance. He also championed       
 the County's Family Mental Health                
 Collaborative, which is now being used on a      
 national level as a creative solution to the many
 problems associated with serving the mental      
 health needs of an often underserved segment     
 of a community.

parent, she ruled with a steel hand, a loving    
 heart and a tremendous amount of energy. Her

 While they were enrolled in Riddick              
 Elementary, she became the president of the      
 school's PTA. When the oldest graduated and      
 started Sumner High School, she followed and

 the position of 1st Vice President of the St.    
 Louis Council of Parents and Teachers. She is    
 truly a mentor and an elder of "many villages."

 Honorable Jeffrey L. Boyd,Alderman 22nd Ward      
            Resolution No. 220                     
 St. Louis Police Athletic League (PAL)            
      WHEREAS, the St. Louis Police                
 Athletic League (PAL) was reorganized in 1996     
 by several St. Louis Police officers including    
 Lt. Colonel Gregory Hawkins. It has grown         
 substantially in that period of time due to the   
 hard work and dedication of numerous              
 volunteers; and                                   
       WHEREAS, PAL is a volunteer based           
 juvenile crime prevention program located in      
 the city of St. Louis and surrounding areas.      
 PAL strives to reduce crime by involving at       
 risk youth in athletic, educational and cultural  
programs, which PAL operates and provides        
with the cooperation of the St. Louis            
Metropolitan Police Department; and              
       WHEREAS, PAL `a mission is to             
identify at risk youths between the ages of 5    
and 18. They provide a positive and              
constructive environment through sports for      
the children to grow and develop. They want      
to fill playgrounds, not prisons; and            
      WHEREAS, unlike other children sports      
programs, PAL has the support and                
involvement of the St. Louis Police              
Department. Each and every team they             
sponsor has a police volunteer involved. Police  
Officers volunteer their time as coaches,        
officials and mentors to the children in the     
program. They believe that if children can       
grow to respect police officers in a gym or on   
a ball field, they will respect the officer off  
the field, as well as respect the laws that the  
police enforce; and                              
     WHEREAS, PAL currently has over             
1000 children between the ages of 6-18           
participating in one or more sports. It          
currently offers teams in the following sports:  
baseball, basketball, bowling, boxing, soccer,   
softball, street hockey and tennis; and          
     WHEREAS, in order to stay eligible for      
the PAL program, participating children must     
have the following: satisfactory attendance in   
school, satisfactory grades in school and        
progress towards graduation, and no              
involvement in criminal or delinquent behavior;  
and                                              
     WHEREAS, PAL has literally hundreds         
of success stories. 75% of all the children      
involved in PAL will improve their grades and    
school attendance. The rate of PAL kids          
involved in any type of crime is extremely       
low when compared to the area in which PAL       
sponsors programs.                               
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
the City of St. Louis that we pause to

youths of the City of St. Louis, and we further
