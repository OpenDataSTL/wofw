Among other factors, the Board will consider

This Ordinance requires that, unless specific

work pursuant to a contract executed between       
the successful bidder and the City must be         
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage

applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.

    1)    Where health benefits as defined in    
          the Ordinance are provided to the      
          employee, the living wage rate is      
          $11.58 per hour (130% of the federal   
          poverty level income guideline for a   
          family of three); and                  
    2)    Where health benefits as defined in    
          the Ordinance are not provided to      
          the employee, the living wage rate is  
          $15.08 per hour (130% of the federal
