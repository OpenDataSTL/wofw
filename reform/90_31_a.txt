 meet the practical needs of its neighbors, but     
 also seeks to strengthen its relationship with     
 Christ through the programs offered by the         
 church. Members of the church staff reside in

 Church exists to ignite a unified movement of      
 the Good News of Jesus Christ that will            
 change our community and St. Louis in every        
 way-spiritually, physically, socially and          
 culturally-and throughout St. Louis and the

 person can do if they try despite what the         
 odds are or look like.

Honorable Freeman Bosley, Sr. Alderman 3rd Ward   
           Resolution No. 200                     
     WHEREAS, Mr. & Mrs. Donald                   
Muhammad moved into the Hyde Park                 
Historic District some five years ago into a      
neighborhood that many thought was a lost         
cause and an investment that was a total loss     
and a waste of resources; and                     
     WHEREAS, the house that they                 
purchased was the subject of many complaints      
and had been requested to be demolished.          
Today, it is a source of pride in the Hyde Park   
neighborhood and is a beautiful home; and         
     WHEREAS, not only did the                    
Muhammads turn an eye sore into a beautiful       
home, but they also took a vacant lot full of     
weeds and weed trees and turned it into a         
beautifully landscaped garden and green space     
on the corner of Salisbury and 20th Street. This  
garden was the subject of much conversation       
during this year's Hyde Park House Tour; and      
      WHEREAS, the Muhammads saw an               
opportunity instead of an eyesore and to their    
credit rolled up their sleeves and went to work   
making their area a better place for everyone     
and our City. They have demonstrated that         
anyone who cares and tries, can make a            
difference.

Muhammad for their unselfish and tireless         
devotion and contributions to make a              
difference in their neighborhood, and we
