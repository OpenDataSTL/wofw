           Resolution No. 145                   
             Michael Johnson                    
       WHEREAS, Michael began the ministry      
 of music at the age of 9 years old, playing for
 the junior choir at Devotional Baptist Church  
 under the Pastorage of Rev. Nathaniel Dunn..   
 As he grew he began to play for the other      
 various choirs in the church. During his early 
 years of music he was mentored by his great    
 aunt Luetta Massey, Geneva Dalton, Ronald      
 Metcalf, The Kinloch Community choir, and      
 Mrs. Essie Rae Metcalf. He played gospel       
 music in the Kinloch High School Choir, The    
 Kinloch Community Choir, and Premiere          
 Gospel Vocalist Geneva Dalton. His ear was     
 so keen that when he heard a James Cleveland,  
 Clara Ward or other music he would go home     
 and pick it out on the piano. He was a great   
 lover of the Music of Motown because of the    
 music telling stories. He began writing songs  
 in 1968 after Ms. Metcalf introduced him to    
 the music of The Northern California State     
 Youth Choir (The Edwin Hawkins Singers);       
 and                                            
      WHEREAS, in 1972 Michael began            
 playing for Bethel African Methodist           
 Episcopal Church thus staying there for 23     
 years. During the years at Bethel, Michael     
 also played for several other churches, St.    
 Michael's Temple of the Expanded Mind,         
 Nash Prayer Band, New Bethlehem, First         
Baptist of Kinloch, St. Paul A.M.E Church,         
Love Outreach Victory Temple, Northern             
Baptist Church; and                                
      WHEREAS, in 1975-1980 he was a               
musician and lead singer/mgr of a premiere,        
local secular band called "Otha Band" thus         
changing their name to "Sheer Energy." This        
13 piece band toured the United States for         
several years. During this time he was also a      
musician for gospel legendary local group The      
Gospeleers and Zella Jackson Price and Doris       
Fiddmont; and                                      
      WHEREAS, for the next years to come          
God did some miraculous things in his life.        
His territory became enlarged as he began to       
do so many things. He remained playing for         
various churches and 1981 bought him to Ms.        
Sharon Lowery Dent in East St Louis. Ms            
Dent had a vision of starting a recording studio,  
music school and entertainment complex and         
she hired Michael to develop the dream and         
after two years the music school had over 200      
students, piano, vocal, bass and lead guitar       
teachers; and                                      
      WHEREAS, In 1982 world renowned              
saxophonist/producer, Oliver Sain used             
Michael for several recording sessions with        
various artists thus leading to him recording      
Michael and The Michael Johnson Singers and        
a solo project on Michael. Both projects were      
released in the national and international         
market and did very well; and                      
      WHEREAS, Michael remained faithful           
to his churches locally which would cause          
friction with the record company executives        
because it limited his traveling to promote the    
recordings; and                                    
     WHEREAS, the nineties brought him             
more areas into Radio, GMWA and the El             
King Music group. This was an era that             
Michael learned more and shared all he had         
learned from the previous years with new           
people in his ministry life; and                   
     WHEREAS, 2000 brought more areas              
of ministry, several funeral homes would now       
want him to be a part of their staff for their     
music. His affiliation with gospel music           
Workshop of America brought more                   
recognition to him as a songwriter resulting in    
a composition entitled "When You pray" to          
be part of New music Class for 2 years and in      
Mass Choir for 1 year resulting in the             
combined sales of over 4000 copies of sheet        
music. The song was later recorded by the          
Gateway area Chapter Choir and also The St         
Louis fellowship Choir; and                        
     WHEREAS, he is currently Minister of          
Music at Southern Mission Baptist Church           
in Kinloch under the Pastorage of Bishop John      
 Mitchell and Minister Of Music at                
 Metropolitan Baptist Church under the            
 Pastorage of Rev. Leonard Dennis.
