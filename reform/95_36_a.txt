     of the Board of Aldermen                 
      To the President of the Board of        
 Aldermen:                                    
      I wish to report that on the 16th day of
November, 2012, I delivered to the Office of     
the Mayor of the City of St. Louis the           
following board bills that were truly agreed to  
and finally adopted.                             
           Board Bill No. 190                    
      An ordinance approving a blighting study   
and redevelopment plan dated September 25,       
2012 for the 2710-16 Lafayette Ave.              
Redevelopment Area (as further defined herein,   
the "Plan") after finding that said              
Redevelopment Area ("Area") is blighted as       
defined in Section 99.320 of the Revised         
Statutes of Missouri, as amended (the            
"Statute" being Sections 99.300 to 99.715        
RSMo inclusive, as amended); containing a        
description of the boundaries of the Area in     
the City of St. Louis ("City"), attached hereto  
and incorporated herein as Attachment "A",       
finding that redevelopment and rehabilitation    
of the Area is in the interest of the public     
health, safety, morals and general welfare of    
the people of the City; approving the Plan       
attached hereto and incorporated herein as       
Attachment "B", pursuant to Section 99.430       
RSMo, as amended; finding that there is a        
feasible financial plan for the redevelopment    
of the Area which affords maximum                
opportunity for redevelopment of the Area        
by private enterprise; finding that no property  
in the Area may be acquired by the Land          
Clearance for Redevelopment Authority of the     
City of St. Louis ("LCRA"), a public body        
corporate and politic created under Missouri     
law, through the exercise of eminent domain;     
finding that some of the property within the     
Area is occupied, and the Redeveloper(s) (as     
defined herein) shall be responsible for         
providing relocation assistance pursuant to      
the Plan to any eligible occupants displaced     
as a result of implementation of the Plan;       
finding that financial aid may be necessary to   
enable the Area to be redeveloped in             
accordance with the Plan; finding that there     
shall be available up to a ten (10) year real    
estate tax abatement; and pledging cooperation   
of this St. Louis Board of Aldermen ("Board")    
and requesting various officials, departments,   
boards and agencies of the City to cooperate     
and to exercise their respective powers in a     
manner consistent with the Plan; and             
containing a severability clause.                
         Board Bill No. 153                      
       (Committee Substitute)

loitering; repealing Ordinance 57831, Section    
827.280, codified as Section 17.16.270 of the

       CONSENT CALENDAR                           
     President Reed introduced Resolutions        
No. 172 through 173 and No. 175 through           
177 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.    
          Resolution No. 172                      
  Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Schicker                  
     WHEREAS, Sgt. 1st Class Joseph               
Schicker of the Missouri National Guard was       
deployed in March to Jalalabad in Nangarhar       
Province, on far-eastern edge of Afghanistan,     
bordering Pakistan. The mission was to teach      
agricultural skills as one of 55 members of the   
Missouri National Guard's Agribusiness            
Development Team VI; and                          
      WHEREAS, Team VI officially was             
listed as a non-combat unit, but in the           
mountains of Afghanistan, such listings are       
subject to instant change. On April 15, a         
suicide bomber blew a hole through the wall       
of the team's operating compound, opening         
the way for a swarm of grenade-throwing           
Taliban terrorists who quickly killed an Afghan   
soldier and wounded several members of Team       
VI, including Sgt. 1st Class Schicker; and        
     WHEREAS, the men of Team VI fought           
off assaults on the west and south walls of       
the compound, holding their position until        
 reinforcements arrived. For that action, the          
 Army awarded 23 guardsmen (including Sgt.             
 1st Class Schicker) the Combat Action Badge           
 and 15 (again including Sgt. 1st Class Schicker)      
 the Purple Heart. Two guardsmen were                  
 recommended for the Bronze Star with Valor;           
 three were awarded the Combat Infantry                
 Badge, two the Army Combat Medical Badge,             
 and five (including Sgt. 1st Class Schicker)          
 the Combat Commendation Medal with Valor;             
 and                                                   
      WHEREAS, Sgt. 1st Class Schicker's               
 new medals will not be lonely dangling from           
 his chest. He has twice been awarded the              
 Bronze Star. Twice before he was awarded an           
 Army commendation medal, and once before              
 the Purple Heart. He began his army career in         
 1978, and took his first combat tour in 2005,         
 serving in Iraq and Afghanistan; and                  
       WHEREAS, this second visit to                   
 Afghanistan will be Sgt. 1st Class Schicker's         
 last. He was knocked unconscious and nearly           
 killed by the grenade that wounded him in the         
 Jalalabad action, and still carries shrapnel in       
 his right leg from the explosion. As a 52-year-       
 old grandfather, his combat career is over. His       
 current assignment is Jefferson Barracks.             
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

Introduced on the 16th day of November, 2012      
by:

obtained Resolutions No. 172 through 173          
and No. 175 through 177 stood considered.

          FIRST READING OF                        
            RESOLUTIONS                           
     Mr. Ogilvie introduced Resolution No.        
174 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.    
          Resolution No. 174                      
        Resolution to Remove the                  
          Elevated Lanes of I-70                  
      WHEREAS, the National Park Service          
has stated in their General Management Plan       
a desire for better connectivity to downtown      
along the north and south edges of the JNEM       
and that I-70 is an impediment to such            
connectivity; and                                 
     WHEREAS, the St. Louis Chapter of            
American Institute of Architects, Landmarks       
Association of St. Louis, Laclede's Landing       
Redevelopment Corporation, Laclede's              
Landing Merchant's Association, St. Louis         
Convention & Visitors Commission, Citizens        
for Modern Transit, Open Space Council, City      
of St. Louis Mayor's Vanguard Cabinet -           
Planning and Land Use Committee, and the          
 William Kerr Foundation have endorsed the           
 removal of the elevated sections of I-70 as an      
 urban design solution; and                          
       WHEREAS, all five finalists in the City       
 Arch River Design Competition advocated for         
 removing I-70 to improve connectivity               
 between the Arch and downtown St. Louis,            
 noting that Memorial Drive could not be             
 activated and utilized to its full potential until  
 I-70 is removed from downtown; and                  
       WHEREAS, I-70 will soon be rerouted           
 over the new bridge into Illinois, making the       
 stretch of former I-70 between the Poplar           
 Street Bridge and Cass Avenue redundant; and        
       WHEREAS, due to the new bridge,               
 traffic will be diverted into Illinois and reduced  
 along the present I-70 corridor in downtown         
 St. Louis. An at-grade boulevard in place of        
 the elevated lanes can potentially                  
 accommodate up to 50,000 cars per day,              
 sufficient for the traffic that would remain in     
 St. Louis city; and                                 
       WHEREAS, the removal of I-70 and              
 creation of an at-grade boulevard will provide      
 new economic opportunities with the creation        
 of new and expanded buildable parcels as well       
 as opening up now isolated districts to             
 redevelopment. This will bring new jobs, new        
 residents, and ultimately new revenue for the       
 city; and                                           
       WHEREAS, removing the elevated lanes          
 of I-70 and replacing them with a boulevard         
 creates connections between the Mississippi         
 River and the City of St. Louis, particularly       
 in the areas of Laclede's Landing and the Bottle    
 District, improving access for both pedestrians     
 and automobiles and re-establishing St. Louis'      
 historic connection to its riverfront; and          
       WHEREAS, the U.S. DOT, in their               
 2010-2015 Strategic Plan (April 15, 2010)           
 stated, "In this era of limited resources,          
 achieving a State of Good Repair will require       
 DOT and our State partner agencies to take a        
 strategic approach by considering and               
 evaluating where transportation and                 
 community needs have changed over time. As          
 parts of our major roadway systems reach            
 the end of their useful lives and must be           
 replaced at significant cost, those portions in     
 center cities should be identified that, because    
 of     employment         and       residential     
 decentralization, no longer serve central           
 transportation goals and are capable of being       
 decommissioned or downsized. In such                
 instances, a wiser public investment might be       
 to reclaim the land for commercial and              
 community use, particularly in economically         
 distressed communities. For example, after the      
 Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco tore          
 down the damaged Embarcadero Freeway in        
 1991 rather than rebuild it, reuniting the     
 waterfront and downtown and spurring new       
 commercial development. Similarly, Fort        
 Worth relocated a portion of its interstate    
 away from its downtown, and cities like        
 Seattle, Phoenix, San Diego, and Hartford have 
 capped their downtown interstates with decks   
 in order to reclaim land for parks, museums,   
 schools, and housing."; and                    
       WHEREAS, in February 2012, the St.       
 Louis Development Corporation issued a         
 "Request for Proposals for Downtown            
 Multimodal Access Study" that asks the         
 selected consultant to "address the potential  
 removal of the elevated sections of I-70 from  
 north of Pine St. to O'Fallon St, to determine 
 feasibility and traffic impacts should the     
 elevated sections be completely removed,       
 brought to grade, and what various alternatives
 might be considered for this scenario to occur 
 long-term." This major objective of the study  
 is recommendations for connecting downtown     
 to the riverfront acknowledging the obstacle   
 posed by the elevated lanes of Interstate 70.  
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the St. Louis Board of             
 Aldermen that the City of ?St. Louis and its   
 agencies shall work toward removal of the      
 elevated lanes of ?Interstate 70 and their     
 replacement by a suitable at-grade roadway     
 upon the? opening of the new Mississippi       
 River bridge that will carry I-70, and that the
 Transportation & Commerce Committee shall      
 hold public hearings to investigate the        
 aforementioned and shall invite stakeholders   
 on the subject to provide testimony.
