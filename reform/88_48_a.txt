 The Honorable Stephen Gregali,Alderman 14th Ward  
           Resolution No. 253                      
      WHEREAS, the 3 rd District Police            
 Partnership is having their 11th annual 3rd       
 District Police Officer of the Year Awards        
 luncheon on Thursday, February 16, 2006 at        
 The Cedars (939 Lebanon Drive); and               
      WHEREAS, Officer Steven Slama has            
 been selected by his fellow officers to be Third  
 District Officer of the Month for the months      
 of September and November and also received       
 a Captain's Letter of Excellence for the same     
 two months; and                                   
       WHEREAS, Officer Steven Slama               
 possesses the qualities that define an            
 exemplary police officer, personality traits,     
 and interpersonal skills that one would expect    
 if their loved ones needed help; and              
       WHEREAS, Officer Steven Slama has           
 assisted victims and their families, who will     
 breathe a little easier and feel reassured that   
 there are caring and professional police

 and                                               
      WHEREAS, during 2005, Officer                
 Steven Slama made 153 arrests and assisted        
 with an additional 93 arrests, succeeded in      
 obtaining charges against law violators from     
 his arrests in 158 felony cases, 82              
 misdemeanor cases, and 311 City Ordinance        
 and quality of life charges for a total of 541   
 charges; handled 1,190 radio assignments and     
 prepared 150 police reports; enforced traffic    
 laws and ordinances to the tune of 278 traffic   
 citations, and 146 parking tickets; and          
        WHEREAS, in one incident Officer          
 Steven Slama arrested a convicted felon in       
 possession of a defaced firearm. While           
 enforcing a nuisance type violation for loud     
 music coming from a vehicle, Officer Slama       
 became suspicious of the driver's nervous        
 behavior and evasive answers to routine          
 questions associated with the traffic stop. The  
 driver eventually tried to create a diversion    
 and dump a .38 caliber, blue steel revolver he   
 had been concealing on his person. Police        
 Officer Steven Slama was not fooled and saw      
 the revolver being discarded by the felon. After 
 his arrest, the suspect tried to lie about his   
 name to escape justice, but this ploy failed as  
 well. Federal authorities are conducting a       
 further investigation into the violations        
 involving his felony conviction and possession   
 of a firearm; and                                
       WHEREAS, Officer Steven Slama's

 outstanding and serve as an example to all as a  
 credit to the Third District and to the St. Louis
 Metropolitan Police Department, the City of      
 St. Louis, and its citizens;                     
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis, that we pause in our
