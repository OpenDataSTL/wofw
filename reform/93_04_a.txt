 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific

 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be

 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.

 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under
