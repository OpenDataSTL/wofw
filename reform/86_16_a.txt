County; and                                       
     WHEREAS, since Holcim first                    
 announced plans in 1999 to construct a new         
 cement facility, the plant*s design has            
 undergone significant modifications to             
 minimize and avoid any impacts to the area;        
 and

      WHEREAS, numerous studies, including          
 one commissioned by the United States

 federal air quality standards; and                 
       WHEREAS, Holcim has generated more           
 than two dozen comprehensive studies that          
 demonstrate the company has minimized the          
 impact of the project to the environment, and      
 that the plant can be built and operated in an     
 environmentally sound manner;

 RESOLVED BY the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis as follows:                  
       a. The proposed Holcim facility will         
 satisfy the economic goals of this Board by        
 providing enormous job and economic growth         
 opportunities and generate significant tax         
 revenue to the state of Missouri.                  
       b. The economic benefits of this $600        
 million project will generate roughly 3 million    
 man-hours of work, employ some 1,000               
 construction workers at its peak, create 431       
 direct jobs in the construction phase, provide     
 200 full-time jobs once the plant is               
 operational, and generate an estimated $143        
 million in personal income statewide.              
       c. Holcim has represented to the Board       
 that they will do everything necessary to meet     
 all state and federal requirements to protect      
 air quality and to ensure that there is no         
 significant impact to the St. Louis region*s       
 ability to meet federal air quality standards.     
       d. Based on Holcim's assurances about        
 the actions they will take to ensure air quality,  
 and contingent upon them doing so, this Board      
 offers its support for Holcim*s proposed           
 cement production facility and hereby calls        
 on the leaders in state and federal government     
 to move this project forward.                      
      We further direct the Clerk of this Board     
 to send a copy of this resolution to the Hon.

 Matthew K. Rose is the chairman, president,      
 and chief executive officer of the Burlington    
 Northern Santa Fe Corporation which              
 operates the BNSF Railroad, and that the said    
 railroad maintains a railroad overpass structure 
 within the corporate limits of the City of St.   
 Louis at 3500 Wellington Ct., para11e1 to the    
 Interstate 44 overpass and adjacent to the       
 scenic River Des Peres, and that his agent in    
 charge of the maintenance of said railroad       
 overpass is Steve Talbot whose offices are       
 located in Springfield, Illinois; and            
       WHEREAS, it has further come to the        
 attention of the St. Louis Board of Aldermen

Division of the Circuit Court of the City of

2003 a warrant was issued for his arrest as a    
result of his failure to appear and defend; and

servant of the BNSF, Steven Talbot, risks        
imprisonment and fine for his alleged            
contumacious disregard of the ordinances of

rusty condition giving rise to the charges

and purge itself of the public humiliation of    
being called to task in a court of law for a

 re-connections and changes in service); and      
 6. FCC rules require that the cable operator     
 follow the FCC's rules and instructions with     
 regards to preparation of the forms, separately  
 listing and calculating the hours and costs for  
 each activity for which the Operator wants       
 to charge a separate rate, including a rate for  
 "basic-Only" converters, and and presenting      
 adequate support and documentation to            
 justify the Operator's proposed Maximum          
 Permitted Rates ; and                            
 7. The Franchise Agency, having identified       
 certain problems, omissions, and                 
 discrepancies in the Forms 1240 and 1205         
 and supporting documentation as filed by         
 Charter, sought legal and technical assistance   
 in reviewing and analyzing both Forms; and       
 8.     FCC rules allow the Local Franchise       
 Authority (LFA) to: seek additional              
 information and supporting documentation;        
 evaluate the correctness and reasonableness      
 of those submissions; seek and use the most      
 reliable data available; adjust rate calculations
 with the most currently available figures; and   
 - in the context of the best information         
 available - act reasonably when setting          
 maximum permitted rates different from those     
 calculated by the Operator; and                  
 9. The Agency has actively sought                
 additional information from Charter regarding    
 the basis for its rate calculations proposals    
 and afforded Charter ample opportunity to        
 respond to three formal written "Requests        
 For Information". Charter's responses have,      
 among other things, provided incomplete          
 support, submitted inconsistent figures,         
 double-counted certain costs, declined to        
 verify the exact amounts of reductions in        
 franchise-related costs, not responded at all,   
 and/or otherwise failed to justify the maximum   
 permitted rates it proposes; and                 
 10. In 1996, the City had accepted March         
 1st as the date for annual rate filings. In 2002 
 Charter, without notice to the City as required  
 in FCC 47 C.F.R. 76.922(e)(1), changed the       
 date of the filing to September 30th, a date     
 which effectively reduces the City's time-       
 frame for review and action from a full 12       
 months to only 10 months, due to the annual      
 summer recess of the Board of Aldermen from      
 mid-July to mid-September.                       
 11. Charter Communications and the public        
 have been afforded opportunity to comment        
 on the contents of a draft rate order and        
 accompanying reports prior to its adoption;      
 and                                              
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED                       
AND ORDERED THAT,                                  
A. The Board of Aldermen of the City of St.        
Louis finds that Charter, has not met its          
burden of proof in supporting and justifying       
its proposed Maximum Permitted Rates for           
the period January 1,.2003 to December 31,         
2003 based on City assessment of the               
information provided and not provided by           
Charter since September 30, 2002, as well as       
various errors, exclusions, omissions , lack of    
documentation, and other problems with             
Charter methodology as described in the Staff      
Report and the Consultant Report.                  
B. The Board of Aldermen finds the                 
descriptions, methodologies and calculations       
in the Consultant and Staff Reports as the         
best available basis for setting rates, and finds  
FRC's recalculation and recommendations for        
Charter's maximum permitted rates to be            
reasonable and appropriate.                        
             Approved Rates                        
C. For the period beginning January 1, 2003,       
the Board of Aldermen hereby approves the          
following maximum permitted rates (exclusive       
of applicable franchise fees and sales taxes) in   
accordance with the rates calculated and           
recommended in the FRC Report as the               
maximum rate that can be charged for each          
item:                                              
BASIC SERVICE RATE - FORM 1240                     
     Operator Selected Rate ("OSR") of             
$11.21 (including FCC fee) as implemented          
by Charter, based on FRC's calculation of a        
Maximum Permitted Rate of $11.23 (including        
FCC fee). Note: On cable bills, Charter            
separates the $11.21 into $11.16 for Basic         
Service and $0.05 for FCC Regulatory Fee.

 ** These items have not been included in local     
 rate notices, and therefore should not be          
 charged and are subject to refund (if these        
 rates have been charged to subscribers since       
 January 1, 2003) until proper 30 day notice is     
 given to the Franchise Authority and

 Additional Installation Activities for which       
 Charter has not proposed charges on Form

 D. The City recognizes that under federal          
 rules, Charter is allowed to impose separate       
 charges for such installations if Charter          
 chooses to include them in Form 1205s (along       
 with necessary supporting information). Such       
 inclusion would allow the City to review and       
 determine the appropriate Maximum                  
 Permitted Rate pursuant to federal rules.          
 Charter's Rate Filing did not propose separate     
 charges for the types of installations or service  
 changes listed, therefore Maximum Permitted        
 Rates of zero for these items are ordered. As      
 a result, for the rate period beginning            
 January 1, 2003 Charter is not permitted to        
 charge for these items and must refund any         
 monies collected for these activities, until the   
 first lawful date subsequent to filing of the      
 next valid Form 1205.                              
 E. The rates set herein are subject to further   
 reduction and refund (to the extent permitted    
 under applicable law and regulations as the      
 same may be amended from time to time).          
           Implementation of                      
           Rates and Charges                      
 F. Charter shall not charge any rate higher      
 than the rate set herein, nor increase that rate,
 nor impose on subscribers any other charge       
 for basic service or equipment not specified     
 herein or in the City's previous rate orders,    
 including but not limited to bulk and            
 commercial rates (to the extent such limitation  
 is permitted by applicable law), unless such     
 charge is first filed with and approved by the   
 City, in accordance with applicable law and      
 regulations, including but not limited to the    
 notice requirements imposed by 47 C.F.R.         
 76.932, or as otherwise expressly permitted      
 under applicable law and regulations.            
 G.    Charter may charge rates less than the     
 maximum rate indicated above for basic service   
 or equipment, as long as such rates are applied  
 in a uniform and nondiscriminatory way,          
 pursuant to applicable federal, state, and local 
 laws and regulations.                            
 H. Until a new rate filing is validly made in    
 accordance with FCC regulations and              
 applicable law, Charter shall not alter its OSR, 
 nor impose actual rates exceeding the OSR        
 then in effect. Further, Charter shall not raise 
 the rates covered by this Rate Order until       
 twelve months from the date of the last          
 increase. For example, if Charter raised an      
 individual rate to a selected rate below the     
 maximum permitted rates in June 2003,            
 Charter may not raise the same rate again        
 until June of 2004 even if the current rate is   
 below the maximum permitted rate.                
         Implementation of                        
       Reductions and Refunds                     
 I.    As soon as possible, but in any event      
 within thirty days from the effective date of    
 this Order, Charter shall make any rate          
 reductions that are necessary based on the       
 rates shown above.                               
 J.     Pursuant to City's Local Rules Section    
 Eight(2) , within ninety days from the date of   
 this Order, Charter shall file with the Agency   
 a certification, signed by an authorized         
 representative of Charter, stating whether       
 Charter has complied fully with all provisions   
 of this Order, describing in detail the precise  
 measures taken to implement the rates            
 contained in this Order.                         
 K. Charter shall refund any amounts charged      
 to subscribers that exceed the maximum           
 permitted amounts specified herein. Refunds      
 shall be made in accordance with 47 C.F.R.       
 76.942(d) and Section Eight of Resolution        
#47, and shall include interest computed at       
applicable rates published by the Internal        
Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional    
tax payments, pursuant to 47 C.F.R.               
76.942(e).                                        
L.     Within thirty days of the date of this     
Order,                                            
a) Charter shall file with the Franchise Agency   
materials sufficient to demonstrate its           
proposed methodology for making any               
refunds required herein. Such materials shall     
include, without limitation,                      
1) a narrative explanation in detail of the       
methods used to calculate all refunds, including  
how the refund amount was determined and          
how interest was calculated on a per-             
subscriber basis for any refunds required by      
this Order;                                       
2) the aggregate amounts of any refunds to be     
made for each affected rate, including separate   
itemization of the amounts attributable to        
interest; and specific examples (from which       
any individual identifying information may        
be redacted) of sample calculations of all        
refunds for representative classes of             
subscribers.                                      
3) a description of Charter's proposed            
placement/ wording of the refund amounts/         
explanations on subscriber bills, including the   
maximum number of characters and spaces           
available on individual bill line items and for   
general messages.                                 
b) The materials provided must be sufficient      
to permit the City to verify whether Charter's    
refund plans comply with the requirements         
of this Order and applicable law. If Charter      
claims that no refunds are due, Charter shall     
provide a complete explanation including          
sample calculations as described above.           
M . The City will review the material             
submitted by Charter and will either approve      
the refund plan as submitted or require Charter   
to make corrections to the calculations and/or    
methodologies used by Charter. To the extent      
revisions are required by the City, Charter       
will make the revisions within fourteen days      
after the City's request and re-submit the        
refund calculations and plan.                     
N. The City shall approve in advance              
Charter's placement/wording of the refund         
amount on the bill and the descriptions used      
to identify the reasons for the refund amounts.   
O. Within forty-five days from the date the       
refund calculations and plan are approved by      
the City, Charter shall begin refunding all       
monies through individual bill credits to all     
affected subscribers and shall issue the entire   
amount of the approved refund amounts             
within one billing cycle.                         
 P.     No later than thirty days after the end    
 of the end of the last billing cycle where the    
 refunds were made, Charter shall provide to       
 the Agency a complete accounting of the           
 refunds to subscribers , stating whether Charter  
 has complied fully with all provisions of this    
 Order, describing in detail the precise measures  
 taken to implement this Order, and showing        
 how any refunds (including interest) were         
 calculated and distributed, and including an      
 attestation to the accuracy of the report by      
 the Chief Accounting Officer. The materials       
 provided must be sufficient to permit the City    
 to verify whether Charter's refunds comply        
 with the requirements of this Order and           
 applicable law.                                   
 Q. Charter shall resubmit its Form 1205           
 within forty-five days from the date of this      
 Order with the corrections indicated in section   
 IV (E) of the FRC Report.                         
 (a) As described in the FRC report, only the      
 following items are to be corrected in the re-    
 submitted filing:                                 
 Charter will revise the asset balances for all    
 assets contained on Schedules A & C as a          
 results of the accounting restatements            
 announced by Charter;                             
 Charter will include corresponding                
 accumulated deferred income taxes for all         
 assets on Schedule A & C;                         
 To the extent the asset restatements require      
 modifications to other expenses like              
 depreciation expense, Charter shall include       
 these modifications;                              
 Eliminate the "travel & entertainment"            
 expenses shown on Schedule B;                     
 Eliminate from Schedule B those expenses that     
 are also capitalized and included on Schedule     
 A (see section IV (C)(3) of the FRC report);      
 and                                               
 Revise the balance of the remote control units    
 to include all units in service including the     
 "free" units included with purchased              
 converters (see section IV (C)(5) of the FRC      
 report).                                          
 (b) Because of the lack of any response to        
 date by Charter regarding these accounting        
 restatements, Charter must also provide with      
 this re-submitted filing an accounting            
 certifications signed by the Chief Accounting     
 Officer stating affirmatively that all of the     
 announced accounting re-statements that           
 could affect the Form 1205 cost data has been     
 included in the re-submission. The City may       
 require modifications to that certification to    
 allow the City to be fully assured that Charter   
 has completely complied with the intent of        
 this section.                                     
 (c) The City reserves all its rights to require  
 further supporting information, reductions and   
 refunds on the basis of corrected data Charter   
 may provide. In making this filing, Charter      
 shall comply with all applicable FCC rules,      
 both as specifically indicated in this Order     
 and generally. Charter shall keep a full         
 accounting of all subscriber charges under the   
 Rate Filing and this Order, so that any          
 necessary refunds can be provided to             
 subscribers as needed                            
           Future Rate Filings                    
 R. Charter shall return to the original          
 approved filing date, and therefore make its     
 next annual rate filing on or about              
 March 1, 2004, and subsequent annual rate        
 filings on subsequent March 1 dates, unless      
 and until Charter and the City otherwise agree   
 on a mutually acceptable date.                   
 S. Charter shall use the Maximum                 
 Permitted Rates set in this Order as its starting
 points in carrying out the calculations in its   
 next rate filing.                                
 T. Due to the unusually large number of          
 errors, inconsistencies, and omissions which     
 violate of FCC rules evident in the Rate         
 Filings, this order cautions Charter to adhere   
 to FCC regulations, instructions and any other   
 applicable law in making future rate filings.    
 U. In future rate filings, in addition to        
 specifying the Operator Selected Rate for the    
 Basic Service Tier as shown as Form 1240,        
 Charter shall also specify the amounts it        
 intends to charge during the projected period    
 for all applicable equipment and installation    
 rates outlined in Form 1205.                     
 V. To ensure reasonable rates for                
 subscribers by ensuring consistency with the     
 2002 Form 1240 Rate Filing, Charter shall        
 prepare future Form 1240 rate filings on the     
 assumption that all subscribers are placed on    
 the upgraded system as soon as the upgrade       
 takes effect for the first subscriber ("one-form 
 method") as discussed in the FRC Report at       
 III(F)                                           
                     Other                        
 W. The City reserves its right to apply any      
 applicable sanctions for Charter's violations    
 of FCC regulations, the franchise agreement,     
 relevant city rules, and other applicable law.   
 X. The findings herein are based on the          
 representations of Charter.          Should      
 information come to the City's attention that    
 these representations were inaccurate in any     
 material way, the City reserves the right to     
 take appropriate action. This Order is not to    
 be construed as a finding that the City has      
 accepted as correct any specific entry,          
 explanation or argument made by Charter not      
 specifically addressed herein.                   
Y. The City reserves all of its rights with        
respect to rate regulation, including, but not     
limited to, any right it may have to reopen        
this rate proceeding based on new information      
or rulings by governing authority, if it appears   
that such new information or rulings could         
alter the reasonable rates prescribed by FCC       
regulations, and any right the City may have       
to "true up" overcharges or undercharges in        
connection with future rate filings pursuant       
to 47 C.F.R. 76.922(e)(3).                         
Z. This Order shall be effective immediately       
upon its approval by the Board of Aldermen.        
The Staff Report & Recommendations is an           
integral part of this Order. The rates set herein  
will govern Charter's basic service rates until    
Charter lawfully implements a further rate         
change pursuant to applicable FCC                  
regulations. This Order constitutes the written    
decision required by 47 C.F.R. 76.936(a) and       
shall be released to the public and to Charter,    
and a public notice shall be published stating     
that this Order has been issued and is available   
for review, pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 76.936(b).
