 Honorable Donna Baringer,Alderwoman 16th Ward    
           Resolution No. 162                     
     The Little Sisters of the Poor               
       WHEREAS, the Little Sisters of the         
 Poor trace their roots to very humble            
 beginnings in Brittany, France. On a cold        
 winter's night in 1839 in the Breton village of  
 Saint Servan, Jeanne Jugan recognized the        
 presence of Jesus Christ in the person of an     
 elderly, blind and infirm woman, who             
 suddenly found herself alone and in need.        
 Jeanne carried her home and placed her in her    
 own bed. In the days and weeks that              
 followed, more old women arrived at her          
 doorstep. Jeanne was joined by a small group     
 of young women who were willing to help          
 with the care of her elderly guests. The         
 Congregation of the Little Sisters of the Poor   
 was thus born from a single, hidden act of       
 hospitality. 170 years later, over 2,700 Little  
 Sisters of the Poor care for more than 13,000    
 needy elderly persons in 202 family-like         
 homes around the world. 32 of those homes        
 are located in North America; and                
       WHEREAS, May 1, 2009 marked the            
 140th anniversary of the arrival of the Little   
 Sisters of the Poor in the city of St. Louis.    
 The Little Sisters arrived in St. Louis at the   
 invitation of Archbishop John Patrick Kenrick    
 on May 1, 1869 and began their apostolate of     
 caring for the elderly poor of the city. Two     
 days later on May 3rd, the Sisters opened        
 their doors to welcome their first elderly       
 Resident in temporary quarters located in       
 downtown St. Louis at what is now 9th Street    
 and Washington; and                             
      WHEREAS, today the Little Sisters of       
 the Poor care for more than 114 Residents       
 without regard to race or religion and respond  
 to their needs by providing four various        
 distinct, loving housing environments:          
 Independent "Home" Living, Senior               
 Apartments, Nursing Care and a Senior Center    
 in Old North St. Louis City; and                
       WHEREAS, at the time of her               
 beautification in 1982, Jeanne Jugan, foundress 
 of the Little Sisters of the Poor, was hailed by
 Pope John Paul II as a woman of prophetic       
 intuition whose spirituality and apostolic      
 message were timelier than ever; and            
      WHEREAS, at a morning consistory on        
 February 21, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI            
 announced that this humble French woman,        
 who established an international religious      
 family dedicated to the care of the needy       
 elderly, will officially become a saint of the  
 Roman Catholic Church on October 11, 2009.      
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our      
 deliberations to recognize the Little Sisters of
 the Poor for their dedication and service to St.
 Louis and we direct the Clerk of this Board to  
 spread a copy of this Resolution across the     
 minutes of these proceedings and to further     
 prepare a commemorative copy to the end

          in the City of St. Louis               
       WHEREAS, St. Louis College of             
 Pharmacy is one of the oldest and largest       
 colleges of pharmacy in America, and one of     
 the few that is not part of a larger university.
 More than 72 percent of the practicing          
 pharmacists in the St. Louis region have        
 graduated from the College. Pharmacy faculty,   
 with advanced education and training in such    
 areas as cardiology, oncology, infectious       
 diseases, diabetes, and gerontology, practice   
 at area hospitals, clinics and retail pharmacies
 throughout the region; and                      
      WHEREAS, since 1864, the College has       
 had an enormous impact on the health and        
 wellbeing of the people in this region.         
 Currently, StLCoP is the 12th largest Doctor    
of Pharmacy (Pharm.D) program in the nation         
and one of more than 100 pharmacy schools           
in the United States. It is also among the leaders  
in graduating pharmacists, nationally; and          
     WHEREAS, the College admits                    
students directly from high school and              
integrates the liberal arts and sciences with a     
six-year professional curriculum leading to the     
Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree. The           
College offers a full student-life experience,      
including more than 40 student organizations        
and intercollegiate athletics; and                  
      WHEREAS, American Pharmacists

month-long observance is a time to recognize        
the significant contributions to health care and    
the commitment to patient care by pharmacists       
in all practice settings from around the            
country. "Know Your Medicine, Know Your             
Pharmacist" serves as the theme and core            
message of the month; and                           
      WHEREAS, American Pharmacists                 
Month objectives are: to recognize the vital        
contributions made by pharmacists to health         
care in the United States; to enhance the image     
of pharmacists as the medication experts and        
an integral part of the health care team, not       
just dispensers of medication; to educate the       
public, policy makers, pharmacists, and other       
health care professionals about the key role        
played by pharmacists in reducing overall           
health care costs by improved medication use        
and advanced patient care and to stress the         
importance of "Knowing Your Medicine and            
Knowing Your Pharmacist" to ensure drug             
therapy is as safe and effective as possible.       
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

           Resolution No. 165                   
  30th Anniversary of Cardinal Ritter           
   College Preparatory High School              
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that       
 on October 9, 2009, Cardinal Ritter College    
 Preparatory High School will celebrate its     
 30th Anniversary; and                          
      WHEREAS, established in 1979,             
 Cardinal Ritter College Prep is a co-          
 educational high school committed to           
 providing an exemplary education to St. Louis' 
 urban youth by instilling attitudes of success 
 and self-worth through faith development,      
 academic excellence and leadership training;   
 and                                            
       WHEREAS, originally, Cardinal Ritter     
 Prep was located in the Walnut Park            
 neighborhood of North St. Louis. This school   
 attracted students from all over the St. Louis 
 area and quickly outgrew the facility. Cardinal
 Ritter Prep remained in this new location until
 a group of community and business leaders      
 formed to raise money for new property and     
 to build a new state-of-the-art school; and    
       WHEREAS, Mr. David Kemper,               
 chairman and chief executive officer of        
 Commerce Bank, and Mr. David Farrell, former   
 chief executive of the May Company, co-        
 chaired a very successful capital campaign that
 began in 1999. Cardinal Ritter Prep raised     
 $22 million from the corporate and civic       
 communities of St. Louis and $8 million from   
 the St. Louis Archdiocese; and                 
      WHEREAS, on May 18, 2003, the             
 current Archbishop, Cardinal Justin Rigali,    
 dedicated the new Cardinal Ritter Preparatory  
 High School at 701 N. Spring Avenue in St.     
 Louis. The school opened its doors for         
 students in August 2003; and                   
      WHEREAS, for the past 30 years,           
 nearly every Cardinal Ritter College Prep      
 senior has gone on to college after graduation.
 All 94 members of the Class of 2009 were       
 accepted to at least one college or university.
 Among them, these students garnered more       
than $4 million in scholarship offers, not         
including two Gates Millennium Scholars; and       
      WHEREAS, their student body is               
entirely African-American young women and          
men who come from low-to-middle-income             
homes. Cardinal Ritter College Prep offers         
families an educational alternative, while         
maintaining the lowest tuition rate among          
private high schools in the St. Louis area; and    
      WHEREAS, the primary goal of                 
Cardinal Ritter Prep is to help students           
develop fully as people: intellectually,           
spiritually and morally. With an emphasis on       
leadership and personal development, their         
graduates are prepared to be productive,           
contributing members of the community; and         
     WHEREAS, their name honors the                
memory of Cardinal Joseph Ritter, who was          
Bishop of the St. Louis Archdiocese from 1946      
to 1967. Soon after arriving in St. Louis he       
integrated all of the St. Louis Catholic schools   
in 1947, seven years before Brown vs. The          
Board of Education.                                
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our         
deliberations to recognize the 30th                
Anniversary of Cardinal Ritter College             
Preparatory High School and we further direct      
the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of        
this Resolution across the minutes of these        
proceedings and to prepare a commemorative         
copy to the end that it may be presented to        
our honorees at a time and place deemed

           Resolution No. 166                      
        St. Louis Dream Center                     
       WHEREAS, after an inspiring visit to        
the Los Angeles Dream Center, Dave and             
Joyce Meyer decided to expand their efforts        
to reach the hurting people in their own City      
of St. Louis. With the help of David and Shelly    
Meyer and a handful of committed volunteers,       
they planted the St. Louis Dream Center right      
in the heart of north St. Louis in the 21st        
Ward; and                                          
      WHEREAS, Adopt-A-Block, their first          
outreach, began as volunteers hit the streets      
each Saturday with rakes, lawn mowers, trash       
bags, and gifts. They cleaned up the               
neighborhood and served the people, but most       
importantly built lasting relationships with       
their neighbors. On Sunday, October 28, 2000,      
they held their first official church service for  
more than 300 people and have been growing         
 ever since; and                                    
       WHEREAS, today the St. Louis Dream           
 Center continues as a thriving, multi-cultural,    
 urban church of nearly 1,000 people that is        
 helping to change the face of the Penrose and      
 O'Fallon neighborhoods. Every week they            
 reach out to thousands of people through their     
 Street Ministry, Adopt-A-Block, Nursing            
 Home Ministry, Midnight Outreach,                  
 KidZJam, and Super Saturday programs, and          
 after-school food giveaways to students at         
 Ashland Elementary and Beaumont High               
 School; and                                        
       WHEREAS, Joyce Meyer is one of the           
 world's leading practical Bible teachers. A New    
 York Times bestselling author, her books have      
 helped millions of people find hope and            
 restoration through Jesus Christ; and              
       WHEREAS, through Joyce Meyer                 
 Ministries, she teaches on hundreds of             
 subjects, has authored over 80 books and           
 conducts approximately 15 conferences per          
 year. To date, more than 12 million of her         
 books have been distributed worldwide, and         
 in 2007 more than 3.2 million copies were          
 sold. Joyce also has a television and radio        
 program, "Enjoying Everyday Life", that is         
 broadcast worldwide to a potential audience        
 of 3 billion people.                               
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our         
 deliberations to recognize the achievements        
 and accomplishments of the St. Louis Dream         
 Center and we thank them for their                 
 commitment to the citizens of the City of St.      
 Louis and we further direct the Clerk of this      
 Board to spread a copy of this Resolution

       Eddie Mae Binion-Johnson                     
      WHEREAS, on Monday, October 5,                
 2009 Eddie Mae Binion-Johnson made the             
 transition from labor to reward. She               
 epitomized how a "good life" should be lived       
 and truly loved life and lived it to the fullest,  
 never complaining and always giving. She was       
 very dedicated to her church and her               
 community as well as to her family and             
 friends; and                                       
      WHEREAS, Eddie Mae, also                      
 affectionately known as "Too Sweet,"               
 "MaDear" and "MeMe," was born to the            
 union of Mattie Jean and Eddie Drew, who        
 both preceded in her death along with her sister
 Lucille Bledsoe. Eddie Mae gave her life to     
 Christ at an early age. She was a dedicated     
 member of Holy Communion Episcopal              
 Church where she was active in various          
 ministries; and                                 
       WHEREAS, she was educated through         
 high school in Tallahassee, Mississippi and     
 later continued her education at Forest Park    
 Community College where she received her        
 Associates Degree; and

 Binion Jr. in 1947 and to this union 4 girls    
 were born; Barbara Jean, Georgiaetta, Willie    
 Mae, and Earline (who preceded her in death)    
 and a baby boy who died in infancy. Ollie       
 Johnson Sr. came into her life and to this union
 her 4 youngest children were born; Gary, Ollie, 
 Jacqueline, and Demetrious; and                 
      WHEREAS, Eddie Mae's strong willed         
 and courageous spirit was evident throughout    
 her life. After living in the Darst-Webbe       
 housing projects, Eddie Mae started the South   
 Side Welfare Rights Organization/Education      
 Association to help end harassment by welfare   
 workers and educate her community on            
 welfare rights and help make changes with       
 welfare laws which she was very successful      
 in doing. Her fight for others didn't go        
 unnoticed; and                                  
        WHEREAS, she received numerous           
 awards and accolades for her work including a   
 SHERO award from 100 Black Women, and           
 numerous citizen and volunteer of the year      
 awards. Eddie Mae's work wasn't done, she       
 still found time to start P.G.P.O.D.A. (Parents,
 Grandparents of Drug Abusers), participate      
 in the Danforth Leadership program, be an       
 active member of ROWEL (Reform                  
 Organization of Welfare), and serve on the      
 board of Legal Services and the Medicaid        
 Board. Most recently Eddie Mae was active       
 in litigation, working to help those elderly    
 residents who didn't have official birth        
 certificates to receive the same services needed
 to continue on in their lives; and              
       WHEREAS, Eddie Mae's loving               
 memories will reside in the hearts of her       
 children: Barbara Smith (Comell), Georgiaetta,  
 Willie Mae, Gary Johnson (Trina), Ollie         
 Johnson (Dianna), Jacquelyn Stephenson          
 (Katon), and Demetrious Johnson (Patricia);     
 17 grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren, 5     
 great great-grandchildren, one brother-in-law,  
 and a host of uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews,  
 nieces, friends and a special care-giver. Eddie 
 Mae was loved dearly and will be truly missed   
 by everyone who knew her.                       
     NOW THEREFORE IT BE                              
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

contributions to the St. Louis community              
throughout her life, and we further direct the        
Clerk of this Board to include a copy of this         
Resolution in the minutes of these proceedings

 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.                                       
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations

     Bidders are also advised that the State        
 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the   
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or    
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than
 the prevailing rate for any work done under    
 the contract by the contractor or by any
