 Honorable Terry Kennedy,Alderman 18th Ward       
            Resolution No. 226                    
       WHEREAS, we have been apprised that        
 El-Bethel M. B. Church will be celebrating its   
 150 th year Anniversary from Wednesday,          
 November 7, 2007 through Sunday, November        
 11, 2007; and                                    
       WHEREAS, El-Bethel M. B. Church            
 originated in 1857 in a small house located at   
 Whittier and Bulwer Avenue in North St.          
 Louis, and the years of transition have included 
 various pastors and relocations but never a      
 split or name change, and this house of          
 worship has sustained the test of time -         
 witnessing periods of growth and struggle yet    
 the Word prevailed; and                          
      WHEREAS, El-Bethel is one of the            
 many long standing houses of faith which         
 signifies that old churches are steadfast in     
 carrying out the mission of Christ; and          
       WHEREAS, the mission has been              
 sustained by great visionaries like the late Rev.
 George L. White who pastored the church          
 from 1957-1985, and under his pastorate, the     
 present church home was erected in 1983,         
 which is located at 5401 Gilmore Avenue and      
 that of course, seemed unobtainable,             
 opposition reared its ugly head and tested the   
faith of the congregation but being the great     
leader he was, Rev. White quickly encouraged      
the membership and worked side by side with       
the congregation to make this vision a reality.   
When his health began to fail in 1985, his son,   
Rev. Dewitt White, Sr. was elected pastor and     
on this historical date, he continues to carry    
the torch, and some say that the current pastor   
is a replica of his father upholding the          
standards of the old church which have served     
them so faithfully through the years; and         
     WHEREAS, this cultural treasure              
nestled in the Walnut Park neighborhood           
continues to expand its mission program to        
greatly serve the community, and they have        
come this far by faith and will forever glorify   
the Lord.                                         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

Church as it celebrates its 150 th year           
Anniversary and by the adoption of this           
resolution wishes to join in the festivities. We

   CALLING ON THE FEDERAL                         
   RESERVE     TO   USE    ITS                    
   AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT                          
   LENDERS FROM MAKING                            
   MORTGAGES THAT QUICKLY                         
   BECOME UNAFFORDABLE                            
   AFTER THE INTEREST RATE                        
   INCREASES, TO STOP THE                         
   MISUSE AND ABUSE OF STATED                     
   INCOME LOANS, TO ELIMINATE                     
   PREPAYMENT PENALTIES ON                        
   SUBPRIME LOANS, AND TO                         
   DESIGNATE THE FAILURE TO                       
   ESCROW       TAXES     AND                     
   INSURANCE IN SUBPRIME                          
   LOANS AS AN UNFAIR AND                         
   DECEPTIVE PRACTICE.                            
     WHEREAS, the subprime lending                
industry has grown rapidly in St. Louis,          
Missouri during the last few years; and           
      WHEREAS, some mortgage brokers and          
subprime lenders aggressively market high-        
cost home loans that borrowers are unable to      
repay and engage in other unfair credit           
practices that strip retirees and working         
families of the equity they have in their homes;  
and                                               
      WHEREAS, approximately 80% of               
subprime loans have adjustable interest rates     
that will increase after two years; and           
      WHEREAS, subprime lenders have              
made these adjustable rate mortgages without      
regard for whether the borrower will be able      
to afford the payments after the rate increases;  
and                                               
      WHEREAS, many borrowers with                
adjustable rate subprime loans were never given   
a choice between an adjustable or fixed rate or   
were promised a fixed rate but given an           
adjustable rate; and                              
     WHEREAS, approximately 70% of the            
subprime loans were refinancing loans for         
 families who had already bought a home; and      
      WHEREAS, more than two-thirds of            
 subprime loans have prepayment penalties,        
 compared to approximately 2% of prime loans;     
 and                                              
      WHEREAS, prepayment penalties trap          
 borrowers into subprime loans with high or       
 adjustable rates and strip their equity; and     
      WHEREAS, less than half of all              
 subprime loans include taxes and insurance in    
 the monthly payment; and                         
      WHEREAS, many borrowers of                  
 subprime loans want to have their taxes and      
 insurance included in their monthly payment,     
 and many borrowers have been misled to           
 believe their payment includes taxes and         
 insurance; and                                   
         WHEREAS, many borrowers end up           
 in foreclosure when they have to make a lump     
 sum payment of their taxes and insurance;        
 and                                              
     WHEREAS, these practices are                 
 commonly referred to as predatory lending;       
 and                                              
       WHEREAS, these predatory loans have        
 led to an increase in foreclosure rates which    
 hurts the families who are losing their homes    
 as well as the neighborhoods where there are a   
 concentration of foreclosed homes; and           
      WHEREAS, these vacant homes attract         
 crime and cost St. Louis money in crime          
 prevention and the deterioration of              
 neighborhoods; and                               
      WHEREAS, many families have not had         
 an opportunity to modify their loans to make     
 them affordable; and                             
       WHEREAS, the Federal Home                  
 Ownership and Equity Protection Act              
 (HOEPA) instructs the Federal Reserve Board      
 to protect consumers from predatory lending      
 (15 U.S.C. 1639 (L) (2)); and                    
       WHEREAS, any regulations issued by         
 the Federal Reserve would have the same effect   
 as law and would cover all mortgage lenders in   
 the country.                                     
       NOW, THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our       
 deliberations to urge the Federal Reserve to     
 use its authority to prohibit lenders from       
 making mortgages that quickly become             
 unaffordable after the interest rate increases,  
 to stop the misuse and abuse of stated income    
 loans, to eliminate prepayment penalties on      
 subprime loans, and to designate the failure to  
 escrow taxes and insurance in subprime loans     
 as an unfair and deceptive practice.

       Thursday, November 15, 2007                 
      The City of St. Louis, through the           
 Lambert St. Louis International Airport (R)       
 Authority, is launching a major program to        
 redefine, renovate, and enhance terminal,         
 concourse, and passenger support facilities at    
 the Airport. The renovations will re-establish    
 Lambert as the new "front-door" to St. Louis.     
       As the City embarks on this program,        
 we will issue a series of Requests for            
 Qualifications (RFQs) to interested               
 architectural and engineering design firms        
 experienced in airport terminal renovation        
 projects. The City has established Minority       
 Business Enterprise/Women Business                
 Enterprise (M/WBE) participation goals of         
 25% and 5% respectively for this program.         
 To further support the City's commitment to       
 involving M/WBE firms in meaningful roles         
 on all consultant work, we are employing two      
 strategies.                                       
       First, a M/WBE Outreach Session has         
 been scheduled for 9 a.m., November 15, 2007      
 at the Renaissance Hotel Airport, 9801 Natural    
 Bridge Road. The M/WBE Outreach Session           
 provides the opportunity for interested           
 consultants to learn about the renovation         
 program from the City and its Program             
 Manager, as well as form strategic                
 partnerships for pending business                 
 opportunities. Prime consultants attending        
 the Outreach Session will receive five (5)        
 bonus points to the scoring of their eventual     
 Statement of Qualifications (SOQ) submittal.      
       Secondly, M/WBEs attending the              
 Outreach Session will have an advance             
 opportunity to complete the M/WBE                 
 Capabilities Profile which the City will          
 distribute to registered recipients of the RFQs.  
 Each firm receiving this notice is invited to     
 return the attached Profile.
