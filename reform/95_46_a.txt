       WHEREAS, the Missouri State Historic            
 Rehabilitation Tax Credit has produced 43,000         
 jobs for Missourians since its creation in 1997,      
 many thousands of which have been in the              
 City of St. Louis; and                                
      WHEREAS, the tax credit program             
 provides valuable financial incentives for the   
 rehabilitation and redevelopment of thousands    
 of buildings within the City limits; and         
      WHEREAS, many National Register             
 Historic Districts and Certified Local Historic  
 Districts have been created within the City in   
 part because of the economic benefits they       
 derive from the existence of the State Historic  
 Rehabilitation Tax Credit Program; and           
      WHEREAS, the State Historic                 
 Rehabilitation Tax Credit Program in the 15      
 years since its creation has leveraged and       
 incentivized hundreds of millions of dollars in  
 private investment for the repair,               
 rehabilitation, and repurposing historic         
 buildings in the City of St. Louis; and          
       WHEREAS, this investment has had           
 positive direct and indirect economic and social 
 impacts on many City neighborhoods while         
 improving the tax base of both the City and      
 the State; and                                   
       WHEREAS, the Missouri State Historic       
 Tax Credit Program, if left unchanged from its   
 current (2012) form and funding level will       
 continue to create jobs, generate net revenue,   
 and improve the quality of life for residents    
 of the City of St. Louis for years to come.      
      NOW THEREFORE, BE IT

 of the continuation of the Missouri State

 (2012) form until such a time as it ceases to    
 provide the benefits enumerated above.           
      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we              
 regard the Missouri State Historic Tax Credit    
 Program to be a beneficial economic              
 development program that creates meaningful      
 incentives for investment in distressed          
 communities while being a net creator of jobs    
 and tax revenue for the State of Missouri as a   
 whole and for the communities such as the        
 City of St. Louis, in which it is implemented.
