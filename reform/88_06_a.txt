    STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS                    
       FRIDAY, APRIL 29, 2005                    
    President Shrewsbury, Members of the         
Board of Aldermen, Comptroller Green,            
Honored Guests, and Citizens of St. Louis.       
     Thank you for giving me this platform       
to address the State of the City of St. Louis    
for 2005.                                        
    It has become my custom to use this          
time to look forward to the year of              
opportunities and challenges ahead of us.        
      But, I would like to pause for a moment    
to look back to 2004 to remember the loss of     
two serving members of this chamber: Colleen     
Sondermann and Dan Kirner. What these two        
very different people had in common was a        
sense of public service that bettered the lives  
of those around them. May peace -- and the       
thanks of a grateful City -- be with them.       
     As I now look forward, I know that the      
success we have this year will depend on a       
continued partnership with the Board of          
Aldermen.                                        
     This past year, we teamed up to continue    
the growth that has seen . . .                   
     New restaurants, like Miss Betty's and      
Red Moon, that are attracting diners from        
throughout the region;                           
      Businesses, like A-B and BJC, that are     
expanding their City operations and others       
that are moving into the City from outlying      
suburbs;                                         
     Suburban retailers, like Target and         
Lowes, that are building new City locations      
and innovative home-grown retailers              
celebrating success;                             
      Entertainment districts like the Delmar    
Loop and Washington Avenue that are now          
counted among the most entertaining and          
unique places in the country - and we have       
laid the groundwork for exciting new venues      
like the Riverfront; the Bottle District; the    
bike trails and greenways; and Ballpark Village  
that will add even more energy to City living;   
     Historic homes that are being renovated     
throughout the City and vacant warehouses        
and factory buildings that are being reborn as   
urban lofts; and                                 
      New homes that are being built in areas    
that have not seen true investment for decades.  
     We have - together - made City              
neighborhoods that are safer and cleaner; and    
a City government that is fairer and leaner.     
The budget document that you will soon           
 consider upholds those values. It includes       
 my strong recommendation to keep 40              
 additional police officers, staff the Most       
 Violent Offenders program, and strengthen our    
 Problem Properties Task Force.                   
      I would like to thank each member of        
 the Board of Aldermen -- and all of the          
 County office holders -- for your leadership,    
 and for being strong partners as we work to      
 make our City a great city.                      
       On Inauguration Day last week, I began     
 to outline a plan for the coming year - and for  
 the ne xt four years.                            
       We have a lot to accomplish, but there     
 are three issues at the top of my list: helping  
 children; strengthening our City economy         
 with new jobs; and capitalizing on the new       
 enthusiasm in the region for City living.        
      Let's start with the kids.                  
      Thousands of City kids - black and white    
 -- live in safe neighborhoods, attend good       
 schools, and will have great futures.            
      Others do not. They will not finish         
 school; and they will not find good jobs. They   
 are not engaged by their teachers. They don't    
 play soccer or volleyball or baseball. They      
 have no place to go after school, except street  
 corners. They have few positive adult role       
 models. At ten years old -- fifteen years old,   
 seventeen years old - they are already           
 disconnected from our community.                 
      And, we want them back. They are our        
 future and responsibility.                       
       For the last couple of years we have       
 been laying the groundwork for a large-scale     
 effort to enlist the resources of our entire     
 community in rescuing children. The              
 Commission on Children, Youth, and Families,     
 which meets in May, is only the most visible     
 part of an effort that also includes passage of  
 the K for Kids Initiative last November.         
       We have worked with the St. Louis          
 public schools to ensure that more of its        
 resources are being spent in the classroom -     
 on students and their teachers, rather than on   
 less necessary things. But, there remains much   
 more to be done in the area of student           
 achievement. I hope you will join me in          
 supporting our new superintendent, Dr. Creg      
 Williams, and his management team as they        
 work to improve the quality of education our     
 children receive. I intend to ask the Board of   
 Education to provide priority placement for      
 neighborhood residents in all public schools,    
 including magnet schools. And, I have already    
 asked them to consider a return to K-through-    
 8 neighborhood schools in our City.              
      We have also worked with the                
 Archdiocese to keep as many parochial schools    
 open as their parishes can afford and to         
 consolidate weak schools to increase the         
 viability of all schools.                        
      We have made our case for additional        
 schools with good data and solid projections.    
 We acknowledge their challenges. But, the        
 Archdiocese must share more of our faith in      
 the City's future.                               
      We will continue those efforts with         
 public and parochial educators, but they will    
 not be enough.                                   
        Through my educational liaison, I plan    
 to work with community groups and                
 businesses to create more, and better charter    
 schools in the City; and to increase the number  
 of private schools. At the end of this year, I   
 want to have increased the number of good        
 choices City parents have for their kids. Soon,  
 I will be announcing plans for two new charter   
 schools in South City. And we are also           
 working to create a Downtown charter school.     
       Without high school diplomas and the       
 skills that come with them, no child can         
 succeed in today's world. At the end of four     
 years of these efforts, I want to have doubled   
 the number of kids graduating from high          
 schools - public, private, and parochial -- in   
 the City.                                        
       One of the most successful early           
 childhood programs is "Parents as Teachers."     
 The program teaches parents how to raise         
 healthy children, and gives them the tools to    
 do so. In the last four years, we have raised    
 the percentage of eligible City children enrolled
 in the program to 39 percent, from 18 percent.   
 But, we need to do more. This year, I will       
 work with our library system, neighborhood       
 organizations, schools, daycare centers,         
 churches, and the K for Kids Initiative to enroll
 more families. And, at the end of four years,    
 I want to have matched the enrollment rate of    
 suburban communities that enroll more than       
 three-quarters of their families in Parents as   
 Teachers.                                        
       It is important that we give our kids      
 something to do when they are not in school.     
 So, I have been giving a great deal of thought   
 to our parks and our recreation centers. To be   
 honest, they are underwhelming. Forest Park      
 and few others are wonderful. But many of        
 the other parks and all of the centers need      
 attention. Most of our recreation facilities,    
 including the pools, are outdated and under-     
 equipped. Many community centers are             
 shabby. And, some are closed. Taken together,    
 they are an embarrassment.                       
     Over the next year, I will ask the Parks      
and Recreation staff to consider new               
directions: improving parks, expanding             
recreational opportunities within the parks,       
consolidating the centers, building new centers,   
working with the school district to co-develop     
some centers, and cooperating with private         
programs that are getting better results.          
      It doesn't matter to parents if a facility   
was built by the school district or by the         
Board of Public Service. It doesn't matter if a    
sports league or an after school program is        
managed by the Recreation Division or by the       
Boys and Girls Clubs. At the end of four           
years, there should be a seamless network of       
parks; school, neighborhood, and community         
recreation centers; and after-school programs      
that all our children can actually use and enjoy.  
After we agree on a plan, I will likely propose    
a bond issue to fund the City's investment in      
its young people.                                  
      One of the things that every parent and      
teacher knows is that the early years are crucial  
to a child 's development. In those years,         
environmental hazards like lead and asbestos       
can do great damage. And, in those years, the      
habits taught by good early childhood              
education programs, well-run Head Start            
programs, and high quality day care programs       
are the necessary foundation to later success.     
      We have made good progress on lead           
safety. Our program is gaining national            
attention for its innovations and efficiency.      
We must continue our efforts to produce and        
catalogue lead-safe housing, and work with         
the public school district to ensure lead-safe     
schools and playgrounds. In addition, I have       
asked the Health Department to intensify its       
initiatives on childhood immunizations and         
obesity.                                           
      After a great deal of well-intentioned       
discussion and preparation last year, a plan       
to build a new Head Start Center failed. During    
the next year, I hope to preside over the          
groundbreaking of a new Head Start Center in       
neighborhoods that need it.                        
      And, finally, in order to ensure that we     
have high-quality early childhood programs         
available in the City to provide firm              
foundations for success in school, we must         
identify quality day care providers whose          
facilities can be expanded to serve more           
children; streamline the licensing process so      
that quality providers can establish affordable    
programs where they are most needed; and           
strengthen our regulatory system to identify       
and close down shady operators. I look             
forward to working with you to find suitable       
locations that attract families to your            
neighborhoods and jobs to our community.           
      When we take stock of our City's               
 economy, we find some good news - and               
 continued challenges and opportunities.             
       Four years ago, I promised businesses         
 that they would no l onger have to fight City       
 Hall to create jobs in the City of St. Louis.       
       Many things have improved. Our job            
 training programs have improved dramatically.       
 Permits are easier. Minority certification is       
 easier. Land uses are clearer and better defined.   
 Development is smart and proactive. City            
 government works as a team and treats               
 businesses like customers.                          
       In the past four years, more than $500        
 million in private capital has been invested in     
 business facilities and another $500 million in     
 building our institutions. This investment was      
 supported by an additional $200 million of          
 local government investment in public facilities    
 and infrastructure.                                 
       Dial, Proctor & Gamble, BJC, Tums,            
 Anheuser Busch -- and others -- expanded            
 their City operations. HOK, Bryan Cave,             
 Thompson Coburn, Deloitte & Touche,                 
 Mercer - and others -- renewed major                
 downtown office leases. Clear Channel,              
 Gateway EDI, and National Systems - and             
 others -- picked City locations over county         
 locations. And, both established national retail    
 chai ns and new, unique local retailers have        
 come to recognize that the City is a great          
 market for their goods and services.                
       Today, there are 225,000 jobs in the City     
 of St. Louis - more than 8 percent of all the       
 jobs in the entire state and 12 percent of the      
 state's wage base. The average wage within          
 the 61 square miles of the City is the highest      
 in the region - nearly $2,000 a year higher         
 than St. Louis County and $6,000 a year higher      
 than St. Charles County.                            
       A fundamentally strong City economy           
 and a refocused City government have                
 stabilized our City's population, created an        
 unprecedented boom in housing construction,         
 sharply increased the resale value of City          
 homes, and inspired a nearly unprecedented          
 wave of enthusiasm for City living.                 
      Today, our challenge is to keep up that        
 momentum. I believe that it is well within our      
 capabilities to add another ten thousand jobs       
 to the City employment base over the next           
 four years, add another ten thousand new            
 homes to our housing stock, and add twenty          
 thousand people to live in those new homes.         
       The point of all of this is to become a       
 self-sufficient city again - a city that generates  
 enough revenue from its middle and upper            
 classes, and from its businesses, to provide        
 basic services for everyone and special services    
 for our oldest, youngest, and most vulnerable    
 citizens.                                        
      We aren't there yet, but we have come a     
 long way.                                        
      Less than a decade ago, no one would        
 pay $250,000 for a home north of Delmar.         
       To get families to take that chance, we    
 needed to provide incentives to offset the risk  
 of investing in an untested market.              
       Today, in neighborhoods north of           
 Delmar, particularly in the neighborhoods just   
 north of the Pageant, few incentives are needed  
 because attitudes have changed and the market    
 has been reestablished.                          
       The same dynamic is true for bringing      
 retail to neighborhoods that have seen little    
 development in decades and in bringing new       
 employers to the City.                           
      To become a self-sufficient city we still   
 need to use incentives to build investor,        
 business, and homebuyer confidence that the      
 City of St. Louis IS the future of this region.  
       We must act prudently, offering            
 incentives like tax abatement only where         
 necessary and using our statutory powers         
 wisely and fairly. But, we also have to be       
 realistic: refusing new investment in our City   
 because it must be leveraged with incentives     
 will stop our progress in its tracks.            
       Government's resources are limited. It     
 is the private sector that will rebuild our City,
 rebuild our neighborhoods, and generate tax      
 dollars for City services.                       
      As I recently discussed with Governor       
 Blunt, this is not the moment to curtail the     
 investment triggered by the state historic tax   
 credit and other state economic development      
 programs. It is not the moment to stifle the     
 nascent life and agricultural sciences - like    
 Coretex and the Danforth Plant Center -- with    
 onerous restrictions and prohibitions. And, I    
 am happy to report that the governor is          
 working with us on a "Quality Jobs" initiative   
 that will give the City better tools to attract  
 and retain businesses, and on keeping in place   
 many of the economic incentives that have        
 brought us this far.                             
       Nor is it the moment for City officials    
 to be complacent -- to think that we have        
 done enough. It must remain our development      
 strategy to use our limited public resources to  
 leverage much larger amounts of private          
 investment. In the coming year, we must turn     
 our efforts, talents, and incentives toward      
 attracting more jobs, bigger businesses, bigger  
 employers, and bigger retailers throughout our   
 City, south and north.                           
Soon, Comptroller Green, President                 
Shrewsbury, and I will convene a City Finance      
Committee to develop a roadmap for                 
stabilizing City revenues and controlling costs    
while the City grows stronger.                     
      I have also asked several study teams to     
examine our underlying revenues and expenses,      
and to make some recommendations for our           
consideration. These recommendations will          
be directed towards ensuring that we can           
continue to grow our economy, provide high         
quality city services, and continue the progress   
of the past four years.                            
      Recommendations from all these               
different efforts will probably include a          
consolidation of some services - including         
elements of health care and social services,       
and parts of public safety - with St. Louis        
County and other neighbors. They may               
include the sale or joint operation of some        
assets, such as the airport. They will almost      
certainly include some recommendations for         
retooling our business taxes, while preserving     
our revenue base.                                  
      One area that requires immediate             
improvement this year is our regional effort       
to attract business and leisure visitors to the    
area. Never has our region been so ready for       
company with great amenities and plenty of         
space - and so unfocused about how to attract      
it.                                                
      To sharpen that focus, County Executive      
Dooley and I have asked the Convention &           
Visitors Commission to present us with new         
strategies to increase sharply the number of       
both tourists and conventioneers. Their draft      
plan will be transmitted to us this week - and     
we will respond to it later next month.            
      Also, I expect to announce progress this     
year on plans to better use our central            
riverfront - with a new design team to be          
announced next Monday; to improve the              
Gateway Mall; to build Chouteau's Lake and         
Greenway; to return mainstream retail to           
Union Station; and to take back St. Louis          
Center.                                            
      One element central to our City's            
renaissance is our willingness to celebrate our    
diversity. We are very different from the rest     
of our state. We live in neighborhoods and         
historic buildings unmatched in the region. We     
are older, younger, gayer, blacker, hipper, and    
more traveled than our neighbors. Our parks,       
museums, music venues, cluster of sports           
venues, universities, public libraries, and civic  
spaces are without matches almost anywhere.        
     We need to share these things with more       
people - and we need to share our people           
with more people.                                  
       In addition to the strategies proposed       
 by the CVC, I propose to add another 50            
 miles of bike routes and trails in the City this   
 year to continue to connect our neighborhoods      
 to each other and all neighborhoods to the         
 river and to the parks. In four years, I believe   
 that the spokes of all the trails and routes will  
 exceed 250 miles - making the City of St.          
 Louis one of the bike-friendliest cities in the    
 country.                                           
       And, with the nearly unblemished             
 example of a successful week of Final Four         
 celebration earlier this month, I will announce    
 the designation of a new Celebration Center,       
 an office funded by the private and public         
 sectors that will work with the City to enhance    
 civic events like Fair St. Louis and River         
 Splash; to coordinate and expand the dozens        
 of other ethnic, religious, and secular fairs and  
 celebrations that already animate City living;     
 and to invent new events that celebrate and        
 showcase our City's diversity.                     
       Some people accuse me of being too           
 optimistic about our City. We'll disagree about    
 that. Rarely have we had so much promise.          
 Never have we had such urgency.                    
       The coming year can hold great things -      
 for children and for all the rest of us. We need   
 only keep to the tasks we have set ourselves       
 - and involve others in our work.                  
       That is the state of our City today - and    
 a vision of our City in the future.                
      Thank you.

              Resolution No. 7                     
      WHEREAS, the Honorable Board of              
 Aldermen of the City of St. Louis has been        
 apprised that the Tigraian-Ethiopian              
 Association of Missouri has established a         
 committee to link St. Louis, Missouri with        
 the City of Mekelle in the State of Tigrai,       
 Ethiopia, as Sister City affiliates; and          
       WHEREAS, Mekelle is one of the most         
 ancient cities of Ethiopia and for many years     
 was the capital of the Ethiopian Empire and       
 the State of Tigray in which Mekelle rests        
 offers impressive remains of the two-thousand     
 year old Aksumite civilization, awe-inspiring     
 medieval rock-cut churches, unique indigenous     
 architecture, beautiful mountain scenery and      
 friendly people; and                              
       WHEREAS, The area upon which the            
 City of St. Louis was founded was once itself     
 a civilization of the ancient world populated     
 by the native people called the Cahokia and       
 like Mekelle was once a major cultural,           
 educational and commercial center whose           
 civilization included similar structures as       
 those in Mekelle with no other area more          
 densely populated in the Americas other than      
 the ancient civilizations of Mexico whom the      
 Cahokia rivaled, and                              
       WHEREAS, According to recent                
 historical findings ancient civilizations in the  
 Americas such as the Cahokia were once            
 visited and influenced by African explores and    
 traders from Ethiopia, Nupe and ancient           
 Ghana centuries before Columbus, and              
       WHEREAS, because of these historical        
 connections the effort to create a sister city    
 affiliation between the City of St. Louis and     
 the City of Mekelle is being encouraged by        
 individuals in the City of St. Louis and by the   
 Tigraian-Ethiopian Association of Missouri        
 which has promoted a cultural, education and      
 tourism exchange for several years; and           
       WHEREAS, the City of Mekelle has a          
 population in excess of 150,000 citizens and      
 is one of the most important urban centers in     
 the country; and                                  
       WHEREAS, the City of Mekelle is             
 highly regarded in Ethiopia for its commitment    
 to education and the city boasts an               
 exceptionally high literacy rate among its        
 citizens; and                                     
      WHEREAS, many citizens of St. Louis          
 Missouri stand firmly behind the                  
 establishment of the sister city affiliation and  
 pledge to support it through commerce,            
 education, culture and sports; and                
       WHEREAS, the sister city affiliation        
 commonly make cultural educational and            
 entertainment exchanges designed to enhance       
 our international relations and our cultural and  
 ethnic understanding;                             
       NOW THEREFORE LET IT BE

 of such an affiliation and instruct the Clerk of  
 this Board to prepare a fitting copy of said      
 resolution so it may be presented to those

       WHEREAS, groups of Schaafheimers            
 came to settle in St. Louis and were among the

       WHEREAS, they were actively involved

 Louis in its pioneer age by sharing their         
 abilities as shoemakers, wagon builders,          
 glaziers, bakers, farmers, linen workers, day     
 laborers, and in other ways; and                  
      WHEREAS,, they came, young and old,          
 with hopes, dreams, and ideals that               
 contributed to the well-being of others,          
 overcoming the language barrier, hardships,       
 challenges, plus the uncertainty of jobs, and     
 made St. Louis their home as the Gateway to       
 the West; and                                     
      WHEREAS, these Schaafheimers and           
their descendants promoted hard work and a       
positive community spirit by entering the        
community life of the City of St. Louis, and     
loved their new land thus adding to the          
foundation of future growth for the area; and    
     WHEREAS,            descendants        of   
Schaafheimers still reside in St. Louis, among   
them, as an example, is the Perschbacher

Introduced on the 29th day of April, 2005 by:       
Honorable James F. Shrewsbury, President            
Honorable Stephen Gregali, Alderman 14th Ward       
Honorable Donna Baringer, Alderwoman 16th Ward      
            Resolution No. 14                       
      WHEREAS, In 1968, thirty-seven years          
ago, St. Louis City Government and the St.          
Louis Public Schools joined in partnership          
with the St. Louis community to establish the       
Community Education Program; and                    
      WHEREAS, Since that time the Program          
has proven its value and has been embraced          
by the ever changing political, public education    
and neighborhood leadership of the City as          
demonstrated by its continued presence; and         
     WHEREAS, Over the years, hundreds              
of thousands of St. Louis youth and adults          
have participated in the wide array of activities,  
classes and services offered by the Program,        
as well as the community engaging community         
councils; and                                       
     WHEREAS,            The Community              
Education Program emphasizes partnering and         
collaborating with service providers so that        
educational, enrichment, vocational, parenting,     
 cultural, recreational and many other             
 opportunities are accessible to all citizens in   
 their own communities; and                        
       WHEREAS, In a climate of declining          
 resources for both the City and the School        
 District, Community Education makes               
 particularly good sense in that it gives          
 taxpayers maximum benefit for their tax           
 dollars by making full use of school facilities,  
 as well as provide places where neighbors can     
 gather to learn, play and discuss issues of       
 common concern which leads to neighborhood        
 revitalization;                                   
 Introduced on the 29th day of April 2005 by:
