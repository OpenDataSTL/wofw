      WHEREAS, forty years later, tens of           
 thousands of persons of all ages have been         
 served, civic leaders have emerged from the        
 ranks of community councils, and large             
 numbers of service providers have found            
 neighborhood platforms for service delivery        
 through strong long standing relationships; and    
       WHEREAS, the seeds for the                   
 community education program were planted           
 in l966 in response to what was perceived to       
 be an expanding gap between the public             
 schools and the broader community. To              
 address the situation, City Fathers                
 commissioned a blue ribbon delegation of key       
 educational, civic and business leaders to travel  
 around the country to learn how other              
 communities, with demographics similar to          
 St. Louis, were addressing the issue; and          
       WHEREAS, the delegation eventually           
 found itself in Flint, Michigan, the birthplace    
 of modern day community education. It was          
 there that the Flint School District, the          
 community, and city government, aided by           
 the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, joined        
 in a partnership to respond to the educational,    
 cultural, social, and developmental needs of       
 Flint youth and adults. Through this               
 innovative partnership, Flint enjoyed broad        
 support for the school district and school         
 councils and the schools became gathering          
 places where residents could discuss               
 neighborhood issues, develop solutions, and        
 the schools became focal points where after        
 school staff helped citizens enhance their         
 quality of life pursuits through programs and      
 services; and                                      
      WHEREAS, the St. Louis delegation             
 returned home and committed itself to the          
 development of the community education             
 concept in St. Louis. The first designated         
 community school opened in l968 and, as            
 they say, the rest is history; and                 
       WHEREAS, to this day, the partnership        
 continues and the citizens of St. Louis            
 continue to be the beneficiaries. While the        
 program has undergone several structural           
 changes through the years, there has never         
 been any departure from its original goals and     
 tenets. The primary goals continue to be the       
 engagement of the community in providing           
 support to students in their academic pursuits,    
 and the provision of opportunities and             
 processes designed to facilitate parents and       
 other community members being involved in          
 finding solutions to concerns that impact their    
 quality of life, particular those that are         
 educationally focused. These goals have            
 guided the actions of program leaders in the       
 past and are envisioned to be the beacon that 
 will guide them in the future.                
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                      
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of          
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

       WHEREAS, we have been apprised that          
 on April 1st, 2008 with over 30 years of           
 dedication in the fire service beginning July      
 1977 with the University City Fire

 years, Karen, a nurse, (affectionately known

 she loves him and that she sees him in her         
 work every day; and

 Louis and was often invited to the Dowd's to       
 help hone the skills of Robert Jr. and David       
 Dowd but till this day Kim has pondered over       
 why it was that Judge Dowd insisted that           
 Kim lay on the ground and let Bob and Dave         
 kick him in the head; and

 eighty state, local, ballot, tax and bond issue

 his tabs at; Mattingly's, Bunkers,

              Georgia Frontiere                      
      WHEREAS, Georgia Frontiere brought

 Titans on January 30, 2000; and                     
       WHEREAS, the Rams would qualify for

 to inspire current Rams players and football        
 fans throughout the St. Louis metropolitan          
 area; and                                           
       WHEREAS, as the First Lady of Sports          
in her native St. Louis, the city to which she        
brought the Rams in 1995, Frontiere led one           
of pro football's great franchises and was an         
enduring philanthropic and artistic presence;         
and                                                   
     WHEREAS, sitting on the boards of

remembering her as one of the most important          
figures in St. Louis sports history, as well as       
one of the most giving people to charities and        
good causes that St. Louis has known; and             
      WHEREAS, St. Louis is fortunate to              
welcome her children, Lucia Rodriguez and             
Chip Rosenbloom, to succeed Georgia                   
Frontiere as owners of the St. Louis Rams,

            Resolution No. 20                       
           Foster Care Month                        
      Whereas, the family serves as the             
 primary source of love, identity, self-esteem      
 and support and is the very foundation of our      
 communities, city, state and nation; and           
       Whereas, in the City of St. Louis, there     
 are over 1,155 children and youth in foster        
 care, and it is the community's goal to provide    
 each child with a safe, secure, and stable home    
 with the compassion and nurturing of a foster      
 family; and                                        
      Whereas, over 700 foster families, who        
 open their homes and hearts to children whose      
 families are in crisis, play a vital role helping  
 children and families heal and reconnect and       
 launching into successful adulthood; and           
       Whereas, there are numerous individuals      
 and public and private organizations who           
 work to increase public awareness of the needs     
 of children, who are in foster care and who are    
 leaving foster care, as well as the enduring and   
 valuable contribution of foster parents; and       
      Whereas, the City of St. Louis                
 commends foster parents throughout the St.         
 Louis Metropolitan area for the love, care,        
 support, and leadership they provide to the        
 children and their families in need.               
      Now therefore be it resolved by the           
 Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis,        
 that we pause in our deliberations to declare      
 the month of May 2008 as "Foster Care

 organization and the police to fight the         
 drughouses and develop the housing potential     
 of that wonderful area. There she initiated      
 the Teensweep program that employed teens        
 from the neighborhood and put them on the        
 streets and alleys to clean and beautify their   
 community. This program became the model         
 for a city-wide effort; and

 landlord association in the Southwest Gardens

 meetings and establish similar organizations

 City so that common issues could be addressed    
 as a group; and                                  
       WHEREAS, Carole has worked in the          
 Business Assistance Center for these past        
 years where she has provided information and     
 follow-up for many businesses establishing       
 themselves or expanding here including most      
 of those in her own neighborhood; and            
       WHEREAS, Carole has resided in the         
 Lafayette Square neighborhood for many           
 years where she participated in the              
 development of the Urban Plan, and she           
 enjoyed the summer concerts in the park with     
 her friends and family, dancing the evenings     
 away; and                                        
      WHEREAS, Carole has chosen to retire        
 so that she can divide her time between her      
 family here and her new home in Rio Rancho,      
 New Mexico, where she plans to stay involved     
 with her arts and a new career at a spa and      
 resort.
