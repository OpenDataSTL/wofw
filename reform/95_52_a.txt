Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
associated Regulations could apply to the          
service for which bids are being sought herein.    
This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
work pursuant to a contract executed between       
the successful bidder and the City must be         
paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.                                       
      Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations      
are available upon request from Carol Shepard,     
at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at              
http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.             
     Bidders are also advised that the State       
of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under        
the contract by the contractor or by any           
subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).            
Also, if a vendor would like to receive a bid

          EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2013                
 In accordance with Ordinance No. 65597, the     
 St. Louis Living Wage Ordinance                 
 ("Ordinance") and the Regulations associated    
 therewith, the City Compliance Official for     
 the City of St. Louis has determined that the   
 following living wage rates are now in effect   
 for employees of covered contracts:             
    1)     Where health benefits as defined in   
           the Ordinance are provided to the     
           employee, the living wage rate is     
           $12.21 per hour (130% of the federal  
           poverty level income guideline for a  
           family of three); and                 
    2)     Where health benefits as defined in   
           the Ordinance are not provided to     
           the employee, the living wage rate is 
           $15.92 per hour (130% of the federal  
           poverty level income guideline for a   
           family of three, plus fringe benefit

These rates are based upon federal poverty        
level income guidelines as defined in the

pursuant to Chapter 6.20 of the Revised Code      
of the City of St. Louis.                         
The Ordinance applies to employers who are        
covered by the Ordinance as defined in the
