 moved to St. Louis, Missouri at an early age    
 and continued his education at Divoll           
 Elementary School through Charles Sumner        
 High School. Following high school, he served   
 in the United States Marine Corps. Upon

College in September, 1958 and graduated in

      WHEREAS, perhaps the most                   
significant event of his early years was when     
he met and began a life long love affair with     
Doris Ann Rutledge while both were attending      
Harris-Stowe; and

graduation, Jimmie started another "love

Included in this career were positions as         
classroom teacher, consummate principal and       
a brief stint in a staff position at the school   
board headquarters. During this long and          
distinguished career, he was always a mentor      
to many; and

of family and friends was well known;             
however, he knew he had to leave for a while.

relationships and being an obedient servant,      
when his Master called, he went in peace on       
September 19, 2007; and
