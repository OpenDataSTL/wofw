 to reject any and all bids. The Board also         
 reserves the right to consider criteria other      
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.       
 Among other factors, the Board will consider       
 the location of the business, minority interest    
 in the business, prior performance and the bid     
 submitted in relation to the needs of the St.      
 Louis Metropolitan Police Department.              
       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.

 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.
