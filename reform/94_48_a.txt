           Resolution No. 305                    
  The Centennial Celebration of St.              
   Raymond's Maronite Cathedral                  
     WHEREAS, St. Raymond's Church was           
founded in 1912-1913, the parishioners,               
families, and friends of the St. Raymond's            
Maronite Cathedral will celebrate its 100 year        
anniversary; and                                      
     WHEREAS, in the beginning, St.                   
Raymond's was considered to be a small dying          
parish. The Church was a four family flat in          
need of serious repairs and there was no priest.      
But with the dedication and commitment of             
the community, the ladies of the church, and          
remaining parish members, things began to             
change; and                                           
     WHEREAS, for the first time in twenty-           
three years, a Maronite priest was sent to            
serve his people. In 1967, Fr. Robert Shaheen         
went to work to rebuild the parish of St.             
Raymond's; and                                        
     WHEREAS, in November of 1975, the                
new St. Raymond's with over 900 parishioners          
were joined by the Most Reverend Francis              
M. Zayek, Bishop of St. Maron, and 20                 
concelebrating Clergy at a dedication ceremony.       
They had achieved what many said would be             
impossible; and                                       
     WHEREAS, in 1977 a new rectory was               
added, and on November 16th, 1979, a new              
parish center, the Cedars, named in honor of          
Mary the Mother of God, was dedicated; and            
     WHEREAS, in the history of St.                   
Raymond's Cathedral, every Patriarch of               
modern times came from Lebanon to visit and           
celebrate holy Mass; and                              
     WHEREAS, in 2010, the Maronite                   
Heritage Center was opened for all people to          
come and study the Maronite history and               
culture, a long-time vision of Bishop Robert          
Shaheen; and                                          
     WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen is                
pleased to join Rector Gary George,                   
parishioners and guests of St. Raymond's              
Maronite Cathedral on the occasion of their           
100th anniversary.                                    
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                             
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                  
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our            
deliberations to recognize the Centennial of          
St. Raymond's Maronite Cathedral and we               
direct the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy       
of this Resolution across the minutes of these        
proceedings and to further prepare a
