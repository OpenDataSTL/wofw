       WHEREAS, New Bethel Missionary

 Honorable Dionne Flowers, Alderwoman 2nd Ward      
           FIRST READING OF                       
             RESOLUTIONS                          
      Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution No.       
 135 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.   
            Resolution No. 135                    
 WHEREAS, the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina        
 and it's aftermath continue today, more than     
 two weeks after storm first made landfall in     
 the Gulf Coast region; and                       
       WHEREAS, there are many defining           
 images of this catastrophe including the fleeing 
 of thousands of residents from the City of       
 New Orleans; the leaving behind of thousands     
 of individuals who were too aged, sick or too    
 poor to run; images of individuals and families  
 trapped by the fury of the flood waters          
 desperately waiting for any sign of assistance   
 or rescue; the destruction of numerous gulf      
 cities and stranded citizens, without food or    
 water, dieing at the New Orleans Convention      
 Center and                                       
       WHEREAS, perhaps the most enduring         
 image of this tragic historical event burned     
 into the minds of people of this nation may      
 well be the monumental failure of the Federal    
 and State governments to prepare for and         
 execute a swift, effective and efficient         
 response to an emergency which was foreseen      
 for days in advance; and                         
       WHEREAS, those individuals who             
 suffered the most from the government's slow     
 and ineffective response were those vulnerable   
 and who required governmental assistance the     
 most; the elderly, the sick and the poor; and    
      WHEREAS, the bureaucratic failures,         
 which seem to continue to even to this date      
 and have greatly added to the misery and loss    
 attributed to Hurricane Katrina, is              
 unacceptable in this country and must be         
 examined in order to prevent another such        
 occurrence;                                      
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we call upon the      
 Missouri Congressional Delegation and all        
 members of Congress to thoroughly and fully      
 investigate the response of the federal and state
 governments to the Hurricane Katrina disaster    
 and we further urge them to take all the         
 necessary steps to ensure that this inadequate   
 governmental response does not happen again      
 and that the issues that caused this poor        
 response are uncovered and corrected.            
 Introduced on the 16th day of September, 2005

Honorable Lyda Krewson, Alderwoman 28th Ward        
Honorable James F. Shrewsbury, President            
     Unanimous consent having been                  
obtained Resolution No. 135 stood                   
considered.                                         
     Mr. Kennedy moved that Resolution No.          
135 be adopted, en banc, at this meeting of         
the Board.                                          
     Seconded by Mr. Villa                          
     Carried unanimously by voice vote.             
      President Shrewsbury introduced               
Resolution No. 136 and the Clerk was                
instructed to read same.                            
           Resolution No. 136                       
      Whereas, the City of St. Louis recognizes     
that over 58,000 residents of all ages in St.       
Louis City receive guaranteed Social Security       
benefits which allow them to live without           
sinking into poverty or suffering from a            
diminished quality of life because of retirement,   
disability, or the death of a parent or spouse;     
and                                                 
      Whereas, Social Security protects             
Missourians by providing guaranteed benefits        
not only for retirees, but also for thousands       
of disabled workers and their families, as well     
as for thousands of children in St. Louis City;     
and                                                 
      Whereas, Social Security is particularly      
critical to over 24,000 elderly Missouri            
women in St. Louis who receive benefits since       
women typically live longer, earn less money,       
and generally spend less time in the labor force    
due to child care responsibilities; and             
      Whereas, Social Security is also              
particularly important to African Americans         
in the community since African Americans            
 have higher mortality rates, higher rates of      
 disability, and since they tend to have fewer     
 lifetime earnings, fewer pensions, and less       
 savings to depend upon for retirement; and        
       Whereas, Social Security is a progressive   
 program that continues to pay guaranteed          
 benefits for the duration of the recipients'      
 lifetimes, that is indexed for inflation, that    
 functions with extreme efficiency, and that       
 currently operates with a surplus; and            
      Whereas, Social Security generates over      
 $10 billion statewide annually in individual      
 income that helps to sustain our local St. Louis  
 economy; and                                      
       Whereas, the nonpartisan Congressional      
 Budget Office (CBO) predicts that there will      
 be no shortfall until 2052, when Social Security  
 will be able to pay only 80% of recipients'       
 benefits due to insufficient revenue from         
 payroll tax; and                                  
       Whereas, in the past, the Social Security   
 Trust Fund has encountered similar challenges,    
 including larger projected shortfalls during the  
 1980's, which were resolved without               
 privatization schemes and without reducing        
 guaranteed benefits for the elderly, disabled,    
 and children; and                                 
         Whereas, the Bush Administration's        
 proposals to partially privatize Social           
 Security through the creation of private          
 accounts cannot guarantee returns that equal      
 or exceed recipients' guaranteed benefits         
 through the current Social Security system;       
 and                                               
        Whereas, the creation of such a private    
 accounts system would entail a massive cost       
 to our country, adding an estimated $3-5          
 trillion to our national deficit which would      
 take an estimated 60 years to pay back; and       
      Whereas, future Social Security              
 recipients would also pay a much higher cost      
 for private accounts than for the guaranteed      
 benefits current recipients receive since the     
 current system spends just 0.6 cents of every     
 dollar on administrative costs while a private    
 accounts system would waste at least 5 cents      
 of every dollar; and                              
       Whereas, privatization of Social            
 Security would lead to large benefit cuts that    
 would place an increased strain on already        
 overburdened state and local governments; and     
      Whereas, under President Bush's              
 proposal, guaranteed Social Security              
 protections to the elderly, disabled, survivors,  
 and children will gradually erode for future      
 generations driving millions of Americans into    
 poverty and destroying the most successful        
 social insurance program ever created in the      
 United States;                                    
       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT                      
 RESOLVED that the members of the St.             
 Louis Board of Aldermen hereby call upon         
 the Missouri Congressional Delegation to         
 recognize the unique features of Social          
 Security: guaranteed benefits, protection from   
 market fluctuations, inflation indexing, lifelong
 protection in case of disability, death of a     
 spouse or parent, and insufficient retirement    
 income, progressive benefits that are linked     
 to earnings and that cannot lose value over the  
 recipient's lifetime; and                        
       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the            
 City of St. Louis calls upon the Missouri        
 Congressional Delegation to oppose               
 restructuring the Social Security Trust Fund     
 to create private accounts that reduce           
 guaranteed benefits for hundreds of thousands    
 of Missourians, especially women, children,      
 African Americans, Hispanics and all those       
 ethnic groups who will be disproportionately     
 affected and who depend on Social Security       
 for their survival and well-being; and           
         BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that              
 the City of St. Louis be instructed to prepare   
 a properly inscribed copy of this resolution     
 for President George W. Bush, the members        
 of the Missouri Congressional Delegation, and    
 Governor Matt Blunt and we further direct        
 the Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of      
 this Resolution across the minutes of these      
 proceedings and to prepare a commemorative       
 copy to the end that it may be presented to      
 our honorees at a time and place deemed          
 appropriate by the Sponsor.                      
 Introduced on the 16th day of September,         
 2005, by:                                        
 Honorable James F. Shrewsbury, President         
 of the Board of Aldermen                         
      Unanimous consent having been               
 obtained Resolution No. 136 stood

       President Shrewsbury moved that
