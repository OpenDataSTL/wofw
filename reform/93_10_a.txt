  Police Officer Mark Seper, DSN 7592                 
      WHEREAS, we have been apprised that             
 Police Officer Mark Seper, DSN 7592 has              
 been honored as Officer of the Month in              
 District Eight, Area Three of the St. Louis

      WHEREAS, on Saturday February 13,               
 2010 Officers Mark Seper 7592 and Luke               
 Kallal 7857 responded to the area of Lexington       
 and Newstead for a call of a "Kidnapping;"and        
       WHEREAS, the incident involved a               
 vehicle, which had been stolen, while a four         
 year old child was in the rear seat of the vehicle.  
 The officers quick response to the area resulted     
 in them observing the stolen vehicle, which          
 was traveling south on Marcus at Ashland;            
 and                                                  
       WHEREAS, the officers attempted to             
 conduct a vehicle stop; however, the driver          
 fled the scene in the vehicle. A pursuit was         
 initiated due to the child's presence in the         
 vehicle. As the officers pursued the vehicle,        
 they did an excellent job of maintaining their       
 focus of the vehicle, while simultaneously           
 broadcasting all pertinent information, for          
 other officers who were responding to the area       
 to assist; and                                       
       WHEREAS, the pursuit ended when the            
 stolen vehicle struck a police vehicle, injuring     
 another officer, who responded to the scene          
 to assist. The offender abandoned the vehicle        
 and attempted to flee on foot, but was               
 apprehended. The young child was located in          
 the vehicle unharmed; and                            
      WHEREAS, these officers acted in calm,          
 professional manner during a stressful and           
 dangerous situation as reflected above. Their        
 quick action very possibly resulted in the life    
 of a young child being saved, as well as resulting 
 in a dangerous offender being removed from         
 the streets, so he could not victimize any         
 additional persons; and                            
       WHEREAS, in addition to the above            
 incident, during the month of February, these      
 officers arrested 6 additional subjects, during    
 separate incidents. The charges in these           
 additional incidents were for "Violation of        
 Missouri Controlled Substance Law",                
 "Assault" and a variety of other offenses.
