       WHEREAS, it has come to the attention       
 of this honorable Board of Aldermen of the        
 many contributions to the cultural life and       
 artistic fabric of the City of St. Louis and the  
 nation of renowned African percussionist Mr.

 he could; and                                  
       WHEREAS, when he was six his first       
 drum teacher was his babysitter Ms. Walker     
 who lived in Millcreek without electricity and 
 where she would light her coal lamp at night   
 for light and begin to teach the young "Billy" 
 a series of basic rhythms in recognition of his
 budding talents, extreme interest and          
 persistence to drum; and                       
       WHEREAS, Ingram's formal drum            
 teacher was his friend Charles Gilbert of St.  
 Louis who studied with the then unknown        
 but soon to be the be famous Cuban             
 percussionist Armando Peraza whom Gilbert      
 played with in California while he was in the  
 military after Peraza had migrated to the USA  
 in the 1940's; and                             
      WHEREAS, Over the years Hassan            
 used his honed African drumming skills to play 
 with St. Louis' finest jazz artists and others 
 including the Quartet Tres Bein with drummer   
 Percy James, Oliver Nelson, Oliver Lake,       
 Lester Bowie, Floyd LeFlore and many, many     
 others; and                                    
       WHEREAS, in 1966 while playing at        
 the Club Riviera in St. Louis, which was then  
 owned by Jordan Chambers known as the          
 father of Black Politics in St. Louis, Hassan  
 had the opportunity to see the Katherine       
 Dunham dancers who greatly inspired him and    
 whom he later joined in 1968 and became their  
 lead drummer where he also met and played      
 with Renee Calvin of Haiti and Mor Thiam of    
 the national dance company of Senegal whom     
 Madam Katherine Dunham had brought to          
 St. Louis to work with her company and youth   
 in the community; and                          
       WHEREAS, in 1968 Hassan became a         
 member of the St. Louis based Black Artists    
 Group (BAG) where he and Luisah Teish,         
 author of Jambalaya, as part of BAG formed     
 the Omowale African Dance Group which is       
 in the Yoruba language of Nigeria and translate
 into English as "The Children Have Returned    
 Home" and from this platform traveled playing  
 and expanding people's knowledge and           
 appreciation of African culture through dance  
 and drum; and                                  
      WHEREAS, wishing to spread the            
knowledge he had learned, Hassan, without         
thinking of compensation, began to provide        
free drum classes to youth in the area helping    
hundreds to hone their music skill and expand     
their horizons with several of his students       
continuing the ancient African drum tradition     
by teaching others and propagating the culture    
and holistic values that go with African          
drumming; and                                     
      WHEREAS, it would be impossible to          
capture all of Hassan's accomplishments and       
sacrifices he has made in one writing but it is   
exceedingly clear that because of his work,       
vision, sacrifice and achievement Billy Hassan    
Ingram is now the progenitor of the present       
St. Louis African Drum tradition that has         
influenced and inspired other areas of the

     Committee Substitute As Amended             
       An Ordinance repealing Section One,       
 part 86.040 of Ordinance 56716, pertaining      
 to the opening of bids, codified as Section     
 5.58.040 of the Revised Code of the City of     
 St. Louis, and enacting a new provision on the  
 same subject matter which allows a local bidder 
 to match the lowest bid when the lowest bid     
 is from a non-local bidder; enacting a new      
 provision on the same subject matter;           
 containing severability clause.                 
       WHEREAS, local businesses which seek      
 to enter into contracts with the City of St.    
 Louis are at a competitive disadvantage with    
 businesses from other areas because of the      
 higher administrative costs of doing business   
 in the City;                                    
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis             
 desires to encourage businesses to remain in    
 the City and to relocate to the City;           
       WHEREAS, by enacting a local              
 preference law that allows a local firm to match
 the lowest bid when its bid is within 2%        
 percent of the lowest bid, the City hopes to    
 encourage and stimulate local business.         
      BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY OF              
 ST. LOUIS AS FOLLOWS:                           
      SECTION ONE. Section One, part             
 86.040, Ordinance 56716 is hereby repealed.     
      SECTION TWO. Enacted in lieu               
 thereof is the following new section.           
      5.58.040 - Opening of bids.                
       A. Proposals shall be opened at the time  
 and place fixed by the advertisement, in the    
 presence of such bidders as desire to be        
 present, and shall be open to the inspection    
 of bidders.                                     
       B. The bids shall not be materially       
 modified or amended as to price, specification  
 or otherwise, nor substitutions placed thereon, 
 after opening except when the lowest bid is     
 from a non-local bidder. When the lowest bid    
is from a non-local bidder, any local bidder     
within two percent of the lowest bid may         
match the lowest bid. If a local bidder matches  
the lowest bid, then the Supply Commissioner     
may select the bid from the local bidder. If     
more than one local bidder is within two         
percent of the lowest bid, then only the lowest  
local bidder may match the bid. In all other     
circumstances, modification, supplementation     
or amendment shall cause rejection of the bid.   
For purposes of this chapter, local bidder       
means a bidder whose principal place of          
business is within the City of St. Louis, has    
had a valid business license for at least one    
year, and is current in payment of local taxes.  
Principal place of business shall be defined as  
the business's physical office, plant, or site   
where a majority (51%) of the full-time          
employees, chief officer, and managers of the    
business regularly work and conduct business,    
or where the plant or office and equipment       
required for the furnishing of the goods or      
performance of the services provided to the      
City, as required by the contract, are physically
located in the City of St. Louis for at least one
taxable year immediately prior to the date of    
the bid.                                         
      C. Bids may be for one or more or all the  
articles advertised for, but there shall be a    
specific bid on each article. The award may be   
made to the lowest bidder for any article, or    
to the lowest bidder for the entire requisition  
or any part thereof, but the Board of            
Standardization may reject any or all bids or    
any part of any bid.                             
     SECTION THREE. Severability.                
      The provisions of this section are         
severable. If any provision of this ordinance    
is declared invalid, that invalidity shall not   
affect other provisions of the ordinance which   
can be given effect without the invalid          
provision.                                       
Approved: April 29, 2013                         
     The right to reject any and all bids is     
reserved
