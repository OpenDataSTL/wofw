       WHEREAS,, Wayne has worked closely        
 with elected officials, residents and business

      WHEREAS,, during his term, Wayne has       
 continued many successful neighborhood

 enhanced the quality of life for St. Louis Hills
 residents; and                                  
      WHEREAS,, Wayne's fairness,                
 innovative ideas, sense of humor and inability  
 to say "no" to any projects proposed by         
 Rosemary Spitler will be greatly missed; and    
      WHEREAS,, Wayne is an outstanding          
 member of this community whose service to       
 the residents of the St. Louis Hills

 City is greatly appreciated;                    
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 career in public service in 1960 as a           
 Caseworker for the Missouri Division of

to prepare a commemorative copy for

Introduced on the 8th day of July, 2005 by:      
Honorable Terry Kennedy, Alderman 18th Ward      
     Unanimous consent having been               
obtained Resolutions No.102 and 103 stood        
considered.                                      
      President Shrewsbury moved that            
Resolutions No. 102 and 103 be adopted, at       
this meeting of the Board.                       
     Seconded by Ms. Baringer.                   
     Carried unanimously by voice vote.          
          FIRST READING OF                       
            RESOLUTIONS                          
     Mr. Troupe introduced Resolution No.        
101 and the Clerk was instructed to read same.   
           Resolution No. 101                    
      WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of    
our national homeland security to have a strong  
and vibrant manufacturing and industrial         
sector, capable of producing the necessary       
machinery and technology to defend the           
citizens of the United States and protect our    
interests abroad, but sadly our manufacturing    
and industrial sector has been experiencing a    
dramatic reduction in capacity and production    
over the last several decades; and               
     WHEREAS, government has an                  
obligation to promote economic activity          
through the creation of new capital              
investment, which will result in the expansion   
of employment opportunities and help             
jumpstart long-term capital investment by        
private investors. As government leaders, we     
 must ensure the continued viability of our         
 automotive and machine tool industries, which      
 creates the bedrock of Michigan and America's      
 economy. The loss of these vital economic          
 anchors would be a disaster with incalculable      
 chain-reaction consequences for our nation and     
 the world; and                                     
      WHEREAS, on June 7, 2005 General              
 Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer        
 Rick Wagoner announced plans to reduce             
 GM's manufacturing employment levels in            
 the U.S. by 25,000 or more people in the 2005      
 to 2008 period; and                                
       WHEREAS, the U.S. automobile                 
 industry has $475 billion dollars of collective    
 debt and its bond rating has been recently         
 lowered thus making filing for bankruptcy by       
 the leading automobile manufacturers a very        
 real possibility; and                              
      WHEREAS, it is conceivable that the           
 automobile industry's leading manufacturers        
 could close most, if not all its factories in the  
 United States which would cause a chain            
 reaction of damage and devastate local             
 suppliers Delphi and AC Delco who have             
 over 1,000 employees represented by the            
 United Auto Workers Local 969; and                 
      WHEREAS, certain stop-gap measures            
 and long-term actions should be adopted            
 and implemented by Congress to forestall           
 threats to our economy from the problems           
 associated with the automotive and machine         
 tool sectors of our economy; and                   
        WHEREAS, one of the key options is          
 federal capital investment in diversification      
 of the productive potential of the automotive      
 and machine tool industries into a broader         
 mixture of production. Our nation needs to         
 shift into the domain of essential capital goods   
 and economic infrastructure, such as the           
 repair, expansion, and improvement of our          
 national railway systems; maintenance and          
 improvement of water management                    
 systems; and the development of other              
 urgently needed infrastructure projects. The       
 result of this will be to save existing            
 manufacturing jobs and create large new areas      
 of employment in infrastructure and                
 manufacturing for our citizenry in a manner        
 comparable to the best of the New Deal             
 programs that rescued the nation and the world     
 from the ravages of the Great Depression; and      
       WHEREAS, an increasing number and            
 variety of relevant specialists are warning that   
 the collapse of the national economy could         
 occur if certain stop-gap and long-term actions    
 are not adopted and implemented to forestall       
 the threats to our economy from the problems       
 associated with the automotive and machine         
 tool sectors of our economy. The loss of the       
 physical capabilities of the automotive           
 industry, and especially its machine tool         
 sector, could mean the end of America's           
 leadership as a world economic power; and         
       WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of     
 our national homeland security to have a strong   
 and vibrant manufacturing and industrial          
 sector, capable of producing the necessary        
 machinery and technology to defend the            
 citizens of the United States and protect our     
 interests abroad, but sadly our manufacturing     
 and industrial sector has been experiencing a     
 dramatic reduction in capacity and production     
 over the last several decades; and                
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
 the City of St. Louis, that we hereby urge the    
 United States Congress to intervene in the        
 U.S. Automobile's current financial crisis so     
 that we may ensure the continued viability of     
 our automotive and machine tool industries        
 and we further direct the Clerk of this Board     
 to spread a copy of this Resolution across the    
 minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a     
 copy to be mailed to the members of the           
 Missouri Congressional Delegation.
