       WHEREAS, Walter Knoll Florist will        
 be commemorating 125 years of outstanding       
 service, dedication and commitment to the       
 citizens of the City of St. Louis;              
       WHEREAS, the Knoll Family has been        
 a St. Louis florist since before 1883 and the   
 company is considered the oldest rose grower    
 west of the Mississippi; and                    
       WHEREAS, John G. Knoll and Sons           
 grew American Beauty roses. Cut flowers were    
 a local industry, as it was not possible to ship
 them any distance before they died. American    
 Beauty roses became quite famous in St. Louis   
 and the Knolls grew them locally until 1916.    
 During the Reagan era, the American Beauty      
 rose became an official symbol of the United    
 States of America; and                          
      WHEREAS, John had three sons, John         
G. Jr., Herman and Walter Rudolph. Older sons         
John and Herman served in World War I while           
Walter Rudolph, still a child, stayed in St.          
Louis. John and Herman returned from their            
military service to find that their father had        
passed away. John took his inheritance and            
opened greenhouses in Imperial, Missouri.             
This business continues today. Herman took            
over the Holly Hills shop, now at 800 Holly           
Hills, renaming it Herman Knoll Florist.              
Herman did a great job teaching his son,              
Marvin, and his younger brother, Walter               
Rudolph, everything they needed to know               
about the floral business and soon each               
opened their own separate shops; and                  
     WHEREAS, when Walter Rudolph                     
Knoll passed away in 1959, his son Walter             
Robert and Walter Robert's wife, Gail, ran the        
business. They expanded with flower                   
departments in local supermarkets, plant              
departments in the Venture discount stores,           
plus a full flower shop in the Famous Barr            
Department Store downtown; and                        
      WHEREAS, the Walter Knoll Florist               
headquarters relocated to the St. Louis Flower        
Market District (historic Flower Row on               
LaSalle Street) in 2002. In 2003, construction        
began on new state-of-the-art coolers,                
receiving and production facilities. The new          
headquarters was completed in April of 2004.          
From this location Walter Knoll Florist manage        
their neighborhood stores; and                        
     WHEREAS, Walter Robert and Gail                  
Knoll are still working, but their three sons,        
Walter, Charles and David, as well as their           
respective wives, are in charge of the Walter         
Knoll Florist business today. This family             
business continues to be lovingly tended and          
nurtured and it continues to produce winners.         
The business now has 8 retail locations and 2         
wholesale facilities and it also does well with       
an internet business website.                         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT
