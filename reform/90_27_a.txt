      WHEREAS, William Franklin has              
distinguished himself as an outstanding student  
and athlete demonstrating his strong             
commitment to his education; and                 
     WHEREAS, William Franklin is a              
longtime and active resident of the 21st Ward.   
He is very active in the Community of St.        
Louis and has a history of volunteer work        
with The Demetrious Johnson Charitable           
Foundation and HOT 104.1; and

 He is the nephew of former standout NFL          
 wide receiver Darnay Scott whom he credits       
 with inspiring him to pursue football. His       
 academic interest lies in sports management;     
 and                                              
       WHEREAS, William during high school        
 held the honor of being ranked as the No. 8      
 overall prospect in Missouri by Rivals.com       
 after a senior season that saw him grab 37       
 passes for 907 yards and 17 touchdowns as        
 Vashon claimed the Class 4A district title. His  
 high school career was excellent; and            
       WHEREAS, William earned all-state, all-    
 metro and all-league honors as a senior. As a    
 sophomore at Beaumont, William had 367           
 yards receiving and 9 touchdowns and added       
 4 interceptions on defense as he was named       
 all-league; and                                  
       WHEREAS, William was also a solid          
 basketball player who lettered in that sport at  
 Beaumont and Vashon and was given the

 received accolades as a very exciting receiver   
 who used his rare blend of speed, strength       
 and athleticism to excel at the H-receiver spot  
 as a sophomore. During the 2006 season

 dangerous receiving threats and best play        
 makers from the receiver position. He was        
 named Team Receiver of the Year and Team

 from the University of Missouri - Columbia       
 in 2008; and

Honorable Gregory J. Carter,Alderman 27th Ward     
           Resolution No. 151                      
      WHEREAS, Timmy Tucker, born as a             
gift of Christmas to his parents, on December      
27, 1987 was born with the challenge of a          
hereditary disease that found its way through      
the generations before him; and                    
     WHEREAS, in spite of his diagnosis            
with Spinal Serabellum with Degeneration,          
Timmy strived forward with a normal                
childhood. He attended the Saint Louis Public      
 School System. Timmy encountered some              
 issues as a High School student when               
 complications of his illness started affecting     
 his everyday life. He had to stop attending        
 school which caused Timmy to miss his              
 projected graduating date. However, Timmy          
 Tucker was not a quitter. When he gained           
 enough strength to return to school, he did,       
 and graduated with pride from Beaumont High        
 School; and                                        
       WHEREAS, Timmy was truly an                  
 encouraging individual. Even though he dealt       
 with an illness that would make others turn        
 gray, you hardly ever found Timmy in a             
 discouraging mood. He was the proud father         
 of two wonderful children. He even found           
 someone that he wanted the share the rest of       
 his life. He proposed to his love Jamee            
 Johnson on Valentines Day 2007; and                
      WHEREAS, Timmy was truly an                   
 example of how to face challenges with a           
 courageous attitude. When others met him,          
 they automatically fell in love with his           
 outgoing personality. It was extremely easy        
 for Timmy to find help from just about             
 anybody whenever he needed it. He had a            
 good cap on how to make others laugh and           
 people enjoyed being round him in whatever         
 sate he was in. If you asked Timmy if he           
 were okay he always answered "I'm riding to        
 the wheels fall of"; and                           
       WHEREAS, the world has lost a true           
 solder. Timmy Tucker will always be                
 remembered for his courageous, encouraging,        
 and fearless attitude toward life. We can all      
 learn from the tenacity this young fighter how     
 to be more of a soldier in our own lives.          
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 AND MAJOR REMODELS.                             
      WHEREAS, energy efficient building         
 techniques can save the taxpayer money over     
 the useful life of the investment; and          
      WHEREAS, fossil fuels pollute the air      
 in which we breathe and contribute to climate   
 change when burned; and                         
       WHEREAS, the best time to incorporate     
 features that reduce fossil fuel use and        
 promote energy efficiency in buildings is at    
 the planning and design stages.                 
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

considered.

           Resolution No. 157                      
  RESOLUTION TO UNITED STATES                      
  CONGRESS HOMEOWNERS AND                          
  BANK PROTECTION ACT OF 2007                      
      WHEREAS, the onrushing financial             
 crisis engulfing home mortgages, debt             
 instruments of all types, and the banking         
 system of the United States threatens to set      
 off an economic depression worse than the         
 1930's; and                                       
       WHEREAS, millions of American               
 citizens are threatened with foreclosure and      
 loss of their homes over the upcoming months,     
 according to studies released by Realty Trac      
 and Moody's Economy.com; and                      
       WHEREAS, this financial crisis is now       
 threatening the integrity of both state and       
 federally chartered banks, as typified by the     
 run on deposits of Countrywide Financial in       
 California during the month of August; and        
 such a banking collapse would wipe out the        
 life savings of American citizens, and            
 drastically undermine the economic stability      
 of our states and cities; and                     
       WHEREAS, in a similar financial crisis      
 in the 1930's, President Franklin D. Roosevelt    
 intervened to protect banks and homeowners;       
 for example in April, 1933 he introduced          
 legislation as a "declaration of national         
 policy...that the broad interests of the Nation   
 require that special safeguards should be         
 thrown around home ownership as a guarantee       
 of social and economic stability..."; and         
       WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen of           
 the City of St. Louis, State of Missouri hereby   
 endorses the Homeowners and Bank                  
 Protection Act of 2007, as initiated by           
 economist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. This            
 crisis is such that it requires emergency action  
 that only the United States Congress has the      
 capability to enact. Congress must move           
 quickly to keep people in their homes and         
 avert social chaos. This act includes the         
 following provisions:                             
   Congress must establish a Federal agency        
   to place the Federal and state chartered        
   banks under protection, freezing all            
   existing home mortgages for a period of         
   how ever many months or years are               
   required to adjust the values to fair prices,   
   and restructure existing mortgages at          
   appropriate interest rates. Further, this      
   action would also write off all of the         
   speculative debt obligations of mortgage-      
   backed securities, derivatives and other       
   forms of Ponzi Schemes that have               
   brought the banking system to the point        
   of bankruptcy.                                 
   During the transitional period, all            
   foreclosures shall be frozen, allowing         
   American families to retain their homes.       
   Monthly payments, the equivalent of            
   rental payments, shall be made to              
   designated banks, which can use the            
   funds as collateral for normal lending         
   practices, thus recapitalizing the banking     
   systems. These affordable monthly              
   payments will be factored into new             
   mortgages, reflecting the deflating of the     
   housing bubble, and the establishment          
   of appropriate property valuations, and        
   reduced fixed mortgage interest rates.         
   This shakeout will take several years to       
   achieve. In the interim period no              
   homeowner shall be evicted from his or         
   her property, and the Federal and state        
   chartered banks shall be protected, so         
   they can resume their traditional              
   functions, serving local communities, and      
   facilitating credit for investment in          
   productive industries, agriculture,            
   infrastructure, etc.                           
   State governors shall assume the
