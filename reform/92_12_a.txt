 seventeen. She received a Bachelor of Arts       
 degree from Webster University and a             
 Master's degree in school administration from    
 Stanford University. While teaching English      
 and Social Studies in Denver, a student          
 convinced McGivern to help deliver               
 Thanksgiving food to migrant workers. The        
 poor conditions of the migrant workers           
 compelled her, through writing and protesting,   
 to change the capitalistic system; and           
      WHEREAS, in 1972, McGivern                  
 permanently moved to St. Louis. From 1972-       
 1976, McGivern worked for the Institute of       
 Peace and Justice at St. Louis University, a     
 group that taught teachers how to teach          
 nonviolence. In 1977, McGivern became the        
 director of the Midwest Coalition for            
 Responsible Investment and founded the St.       
 Louis Economic Conversion Project, an            
 organization that is concerned with redirecting  
 arms resources toward peaceful uses. Also in     
 1977, McGivern was one of seven women            
 who founded the Karen House in St. Louis, a      
 Catholic Worker shelter for homeless women       
 and children; and                                
      WHEREAS, in addition to being active        
 in many social justice and peace organizations,  
 McGivern worked as a freelance writer. She       
 has written various political and economic       
 essays for the St. Louis Review, the St. Louis   
 Post-Dispatch, the Catholic Worker Round         
 Table, and various other publications.           
 McGivern worked as an editor for the Peace       
 Curriculum Review, the Economic Conversion       
 Journal, Interchange, and Economic               
 Conversion News. She has also written four       
 plays and a cookbook. McGivern has               
 broadcasted a KWMU Monday morning                
 commentary segment entitled "Living in St.       
 Louis" since 1985; and                           
       WHEREAS, Project COPE accepts men          
 and women who have served long prison terms      
 for violent crimes, matching them with           
 partnership teams from faith congregations in    
 a one-year commitment. This next year, they      
 expect to foster 55 partnerships between ex-     
 offenders and teams. The team offers intensive   
 personal help, including tangible items such     
 as bus passes and clothing, as well as           
 intangibles such as friendship and support       
 aimed at helping the person build a new life.    
 In return, the ex-offender offers the team an    
 opportunity to learn from someone with very      
 different life experiences. COPE also owns       
 ten transitional housing units in north St. Louis
 city; and                                        
       WHEREAS, Sr. Mary Ann McGivern,            
 as the executive director of COPE, oversees      
 all of this work, with the help of a small part- 
 time staff. Not only is she in charge of raising 
 funds and administering the staff, but she also  
 monitors the housing program, does occasional    
 training, selects clients for the program,       
 supervises the team efforts, and works with      
 the board of directors. It is rewarding work,    
 but it involves long hours and lots of hard      
 work.                                            
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

       Contractor shall not discriminate in

 any employee or applicant for employment       
 because of race, creed, color, sex or national

 Police Department shall be entitled to recover

       The Board of Police Commissioners        
 reserves the right to waive any formalities and
 to reject any and all bids. The Board also     
 reserves the right to consider criteria other  
 than the low bid in the award of a contract.   
 Among other factors, the Board will consider   
 the location of the business, minority interest
 in the business, prior performance and the bid 
 submitted in relation to the needs of the St.  
 Louis Metropolitan Police Department.          
       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.  
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and         
 associated Regulations could apply to the      
 service for which bids are being sought herein.
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific  
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform  
 work pursuant to a contract executed between   
 the successful bidder and the City must be     
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage   
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,     
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.
Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
the contract provisions related to the Living      
Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
the contract and the imposition of additional      
penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
Regulations.                                       
      Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations      
are available upon request from Brad Turner,       
at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at              
http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.             
     Bidders are also advised that the State       
of Missouri requires workers on all public         
works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
the prevailing rate for any work done under        
the contract by the contractor or by any           
subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).            
Also, if a vendor would like to receive a bid
