           Resolution No .276                   
       WHEREAS , the Historic Tax Credit,       
 Rebuilding Communities, and Transportation     
 Tax Credits in distressed communities laws     
 are designed to create incentives for          
 redevelopment and businesses, housing and      
 transportation in needy urban and rural        
 communities by providing state tax credits     
 for these purposes; and                        
      WHEREAS, the State of Missouri            
 Historic Tax Credit is the national model for  
 rehabilitation and community revitalization;   
 and                                            
       WHEREAS , the City of St. Louis has      
 lost over 55,000 residents since 1990, which   
 is the highest percentage population loss of   
 any core city in the metropolitan United       
 States and the City is desperately in need of  
 reversing this population loss and increasing  
 its tax base; and                              
     WHEREAS , a cap on the Historic Tax        
 Credit would effectively destroy it; and       
     WHEREAS, elimination of the                
 Rebuilding Communities and Transportation      
 Tax Credits laws are being proposed by the     
 Missouri Department of Economic                
 Development; and                               
      WHEREAS , it is apparent that these       
 laws would greatly benefit the revitalization  
 of the City of St. Louis and distressed rural  
 and urban areas of Missouri;                   
    NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
 RESOLVED that the St. Louis Board of           
Aldermen hereby state our strongest support
