       The St. Louis Water Division is seeking      
 a Consultant with expertise in water system        
 operations to provide insight and new ideas,       
 programs and approaches on ways to increase        
 the Water Division's efficiency and revenues       
 and/possibly postpone or lessen future water       
 rate increases while maintaining or improving      
 customer satisfaction.                             
       The project will consist of an initial       
 evaluation and analysis phase lasting              
 approximately 4 months and second phase to         
 implement recommendations. Implementation          
 of recommendations is expected to occur as         
 specific projects and programs through future      
 Performance Contracting. The City desires an       
 implementation plan through the RFP that           
 requires no additional initial outlay of funds     
 for capital projects or procurement of             
 equipment or services by the City. There will      
 be certain Non-Performance Contracting             
 efforts that will result in delivery of a report   
 with recommendations and a detailed                
 implementation plan that can be executed by        
 the SLWD or others.                                
      Black & Veatch has been retained to

          the Ordinance are provided to the    
          employee, the living wage rate is    
          $11.93 per hour (130% of the federal 
          poverty level income guideline for a 
          family of three); and
