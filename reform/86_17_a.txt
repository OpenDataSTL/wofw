 faculty; and                                    
       WHEREAS, in addition to the long hours

      Unanimous consent having been              
 obtained Resolution Nos. 105, 107 and 109       
 stood considered.                               
       President Shrewsbury moved that           
 Resolution Nos. 105, 106 and 107 be adopted,    
 at this meeting of the Board.

             FIRST READING                       
            OF RESOLUTIONS                       
       Mr. President Shrewsbury introduced       
 Resolution No. 106 and requested that it be     
 assigned to the Committee on                    
 Intergovernmental Affairs.                      
           Resolution No. 106                    
      WHEREAS, since 1975 the Earned             
 Income Tax Credit has benefited tens of         
 millions of America's hardest working and       
 impoverished families; and                      
       WHEREAS, the EITC is credited with        
 lifting countless families out of poverty each  
 year; and                                       
      WHEREAS, the IRS estimates 10 to 15         
 percent of eligible families fail to claim the   
 Earned Income Credit each year because they      
 are either unaware of the program or don't       
 know how to apply for it; and                    
       WHEREAS, the IRS is now attempting         
 to implement a burdensome procedure of pre-      
 certification that will most assuredly result in 
 even more families failing to file for what is   
 rightfully due them; and                         
       WHEREAS, this pre-certification            
 proposal will only serve as yet another          
 roadblock and throw up even more barriers        
 for families that are simply trying to follow    
 the Government's already complicated tax         
 filing system;                                   
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                        
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our       
 deliberations to voice our opposition to the     
 Internal Revenue Services' proposal of pre-      
 certification for the Earned Income Tax Credit   
 program and remind the Federal Government        
 that the best way to help America's struggling   
 families is to eliminate the roadblocks they     
 face on their way to a better life; not to create
 new ones.                                        
 Introduced this 18th day of July, 2003 by

            Resolution No. 108                    
       WHEREAS, the Charter of the City of        
 St. Louis authorizes the Board of Aldermen       
 to determine the rules governing the procedure   
 followed during our deliberations; and           
       WHEREAS, these rules are adopted by        
 resolution at the beginning of each Aldermanic   
 Session; and                                     
       WHEREAS, it is our intention to amend      
 the rules for the 2003-04 session in order to    
 provide for the efficient and orderly conduct    
 while at the same time fulfilling all legal      
 requirements for the adoption of ordinances ;    
 and

 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of

 Aldermanic Rule 68A to read as follows:          
 Rule 68a - Third Reading - Consent Calendar

 perfected, a sponsor may request of the clerk    
 that such Board Bill be placed on the consent    
 third reading calendar. All such Board Bills     
 shall be placed on the consent third reading     
 calendar unless there is an objection by any     
 member in which case the Board Bill objected     
to shall be referred to the third reading calendar.  
Objections may be made at any time prior to          
the beginning of the roll call vote for final        
passage. Board Bills placed on the consent           
third reading calendar shall not be read by the      
clerk prior to the motion to adopt. It shall be      
the duty of the Majority Floor Leader to make        
the motion to adopt Board Bills appearing on         
the consent third reading calendar. The vote         
on such motion shall be taken by yeas and            
nays and entered upon the Journal of the             
Board of Aldermen. If a majority of all the          
members vote in the affirmative on such              
motion the Board Bills shall be deemed truly         
enrolled and adopted. Nothing in this rule           
shall require a member to place a Board Bill         
on the consent third reading calendar.

      WHEREAS, the Commissioner of                   
Education, who is appointed by the members           
of the State Board of Education, is the Board's      
chief administrative officer and is responsible

 students in primary or secondary schools; and      
       WHEREAS, in a matter of a few short          
 weeks, the interim School Superintendent,          
 William V. Roberti, has led this community         
 into a chaotic and divisive environment in         
 which the education of our children is an          
 afterthought and the politics of secrecy           
 prevail; and                                       
       WHEREAS, not only has interim                
 Superintendent Roberti recommended the

 deficit for the school district without providing  
 sufficient documentation to support his claim;     
 and

 Louis Public School System; and

 and prepare them for the future;                   
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 Commissioner of Education, D. Kent King,

          Board Bill No. 101                   
     WHEREAS, the Board of Aldermen of         
the City of St. Louis recognizes the           
importance of encouraging new revenue          
sources and job opportunities through the      
 creation, attraction, and expansion of business  
 and industry throughout the region and           
 statewide; and                                   
      WHEREAS, the Board continues to             
 identify quality job and economic growth         
 opportunities that improve the quality of life   
 and promote the general welfare of our           
 residents; and                                   
       WHEREAS, the Board is aware that           
 Holcim (US) Inc., ("Holcim") has submitted       
 the required permit applications to construct    
 a cement facility in northern Ste. Genevieve     
 County; and                                      
     WHEREAS, since Holcim first                  
 announced plans in 1999 to construct a new       
 cement facility, the plant's design has          
 undergone significant modifications to           
 minimize and avoid any impacts to the area;      
 and                                              
      WHEREAS, the Ste. Genevieve project         
 should undergo rigorous regulatory review,       
 involving more than eight agencies at the        
 federal and state levels; and                    
      WHEREAS, numerous studies,                  
 including one commissioned by the United         
 States Environmental Protection Agency, have     
 found that the Ste. Genevieve plant will not     
 negatively impact St. Louis's ability to meet    
 federal air quality standards; and               
       WHEREAS, Holcim has generated more         
 than two dozen comprehensive studies that        
 demonstrate the company has minimized the        
 impact of the project to the environment, and    
 that the plant can be built and operated in an   
 environmentally sound manner;                    
      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT                       
 RESOLVED BY the Board of Aldermen of             
 the City of St. Louis as follows:                
       a. The proposed Holcim facility will       
 satisfy the economic goals of this Board by      
 providing enormous job and economic growth       
 opportunities and generate significant tax       
 revenue to the state of Missouri.                
       b. The economic benefits of this $600      
 million project will generate roughly 3 million  
 man-hours of work, employ some 1,000             
 construction workers at its peak, create 431     
 direct jobs in the construction phase, provide   
 200 full-time jobs once the plant is             
 operational, and generate an estimated $143      
 million in personal income statewide.            
       c. Holcim has represented to the Board     
 that they will do everything necessary to meet   
 all state and federal requirements to protect    
 air quality and to ensure that there is no       
 significant impact to the St. Louis region's     
 ability to meet federal air quality standards.   
       d. Based on Holcim's assurances about      
 the actions they will take to ensure air quality,
 and contingent upon them doing so, this Board    
 offers its support for Holcim's proposed         
 cement production facility and hereby calls      
 on the leaders in state and federal government   
 to move this project forward.                    
      We further direct the Clerk of this Board   
 to send a copy of this resolution to the Hon.    
 Robert Holden, Governor of the State of          
 Missouri.
