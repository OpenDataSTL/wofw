            Resolution No. 76                     
      Whereas, The Save the Children              
 organization recently reported that the United   
 States ranks near the bottom among modern        
 nations in regards to infant mortality; and      
      Whereas, infant mortality refers to the      
 death of a baby before it reaches its first       
 birthday; and                                     
      Whereas, the United States ranks 28th

 per 1,000 live births; and                        
       Whereas, the recent increase is a           
 significant and troubling public health issue,    
 especially for African American families,         
 Native American families, and Hispanic            
 families; and                                     
       Whereas, the infant mortality rate          
 among African American women is more than         
 double that of Caucasian women, according         
 to a report produced by the National Healthy      
 Start Association; and                            
      Whereas, the Secretary of Health and         
 Human Services has designated 2010, as the        
 year by which certain objectives should be        
 met with respect to the health status of the      
 people of the United States; and                  
      Whereas, it is imperative in the City of     
 St. Louis that the issue of infant mortality be   
 publicly discussed and that a comprehensive       
 action plan be developed to address the many      
 health care, cultural and economic factors        
 which contribute to this ;

           Resolution No. 79                       
      WHEREAS, in recent days the citizens         
of the City of St. Louis have once again           
witnessed what appears to be the inability of      
the St. Louis Public School Board to function      
in a positive, community uniting and               
meaningful way for the benefit of our children;    
and                                                
      WHEREAS, the abrupt resignation of           
Superintendent Williams and the controversy        
surrounding the removal of Mr. Floyd Irons         
appears inconsistent with promises made by         
certain board members to this community            
during their recent election campaign and may      
be detrimental to the students who begin school    
in six short weeks; and                            
     WHEREAS, the actions of the majority          
of the school board members in this matter         
can make it appear that a vision to lead and       
serve our children and unite this community        
though education is lacking by the school          
board; and                                         
      WHEREAS, the education of our                
children and the stability of our school system    
are vital to the growth and development of         
this community; and                                
      WHEREAS, without immediate action            
this community runs the risk of another school     
year filled with turmoil and another year of       
our children=s education forever lost; and         
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
the City of St. Louis that we urge the members     
of the St. Louis School Board to begin an open     
and constructive dialogue with the state and       
local elected officials to the end that public     
confidence in the School Board can be restored     
and that the entire St. Louis community can        
have a meaningful voice in the resolution of       
these important issues.
