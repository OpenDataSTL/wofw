             OF RESOLUTIONS                         
      Mr. Schmid introduced Resolution              
 No. 273 and the Clerk was instructed to read       
 same.                                              
             Resolution No. 273                     
       WHEREAS , protection of the health and       
 safety of residents, workers, business owners      
 and visitors in the City of St. Louis, including   
 protection from terrorist attack, is a             
 paramount concern for the City of St. Louis;       
       WHEREAS , the protection and exercise        
 of civil rights and civil liberties guaranteed by  
 the U.S. Constitution, as amended, forms the       
 basis of our free and democratic society; and      
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis greatly        
 benefits from the many contributions of its        
 diverse population, including working people,      
 students, immigrants and refugees; and             
       WHEREAS , the Board of Aldermen of           
 the City of St. Louis believes that there is no    
 inherent conflict between national security and    
 the preservation of liberty -- United States       
 residents can be both safe and free; and           
      WHEREAS , the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis reaffirms its strong         
 opposition to terrorism, but also affirms that     
 any efforts to end terrorism not be waged at       
 the expense of the essential civil rights and     
 liberties of the innocent people of the City of   
 St. Louis, State of Missouri and United States;   
 and                                               
      WHEREAS , Government security                
 measures that undermine fundamental rights        
 do damage to the institutions and values that     
 the residents of the City of St. Louis hold       
 dear and which form the fabric of the oldest      
 and greatest continuous democracy in world        
 history;                                          
       WHEREAS , it is imperative that federal,    
 state and local governments should protect        
 the public from terrorist attacks, such as those  
 that occurred on September 11, 2001,              
 nevertheless, they should do so in a balanced,    
 rational, and deliberative fashion in order to    
 ensure that security measures enhance the         
 public safety without severely impairing          
 constitutional rights or infringing on civil      
 liberties by suffocating what makes us a free     
 democracy; and                                    
      WHEREAS, certain federal policies            
 adopted since September 11, 2001, including       
 the application of certain provisions of the      
 U.S.A. Patriot Act (P.L. 107-56; H.R. 31620       
 and related federal actions, including Orders     
 in furtherance thereof, may unduly infringe       
 upon fundamental rights and liberties and may     
 threaten civil rights and liberties guaranteed    
 as inalienable rights under the U.S.              
 Constitution, as amended; and                     
        WHEREAS, these certain federal             
 policies include the power to authorize the       
 indefinite incarceration of non-citizens based    
 on mere suspicion of terrorist activity, and      
 the indefinite incarceration of citizens          
 designated as "enemy combatants" without          
 access to counsel or meaningful recourse to       
 the federal courts; limitations on the traditional
 authority of federal courts to curb law           
 enforcement abuse of electronic surveillance      
 in anti-terrorism investigations and ordinary     
 criminal investigations; the expansion of the     
 authority of federal agents to conduct so-called  
 "sneak and peek" or "black bag" searches, in      
 which the subject of the search warrant is        
 unaware that his property has been searched;      
 grants to law enforcement and intelligence        
 agencies of broad access to personal, medical,    
 financial, library and education records with     
 little, if any, judicial oversight; and           
       WHEREAS , these same federal policies       
 may undermine trust between immigrant             
 communities and the government and, in            
 particular, pose a threat to the civil rights and 
 liberties of the residents of our City who are,   
 or who appear, to be of Arab, Muslim, or          
 South Asian descent; and                          
      WHEREAS , the federal government has        
drafted new legislation entitled the Domestic     
Security Enhancement Act (known as Patriot        
II), which may further compromise                 
constitutional rights and our government's        
unique system of checks and balances; and         
     WHEREAS , three states and more than         
200 communities, including the City of New        
York, have enacted resolutions that reaffirm      
support for civil rights and civil liberties and  
that demand accountability from law               
enforcement agencies regarding the exercise of    
the extraordinary new powers conferred by         
the U.S.A. Patriot Act and related federal        
actions.                                          
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED, that it is the policy of the City       
of St. Louis that employees of the City of St.    
Louis and its departments shall refrain from:     
      1. profiling based on race, ethnicity,      
citizenship, religion, national origin, or non-   
violent political values; and                     
      2. denying any city service on the basis    
of citizenship; and be it                         
       FURTHER RESOLVED, that the City            
of St. Louis will avoid discrimination in every   
function of City government, and vigorously       
uphold the constitutionally protected rights      
of all persons; and be it                         
      FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board            
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis calls        
upon federal, state, county and local officials   
and upon City of St. Louis agencies and           
institutions to affirm and protect civil rights   
and civil liberties; and be it                    
       FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board           
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis affirms      
its strong support for the rights of immigrants   
and refugees and opposes measures that single     
out individuals for legal scrutiny or             
enforcement activity based primarily upon         
their country of origin; and be it                
     FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board             
of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis              
encourages the St. Louis Board of Police          
Commissioners and the St. Louis Metropolitan      
Police Department to adopt and to follow          
policies that prohibit its employees from:        
      1. investigating individuals or groups of   
individuals based on their participation in       
activities protected by the First Amendment       
to the U.S. Constitution, such as non-violent     
political advocacy or the practice of religion,   
without reasonable suspicion of criminal          
activity unrelated to the activity protected      
by the First Amendment;                           
     2. profiling based on race, religion, or     
ethnicity;                                        
       3. participating in the enforcement of         
 federal immigration laws, except to prevent          
 persons from a continuing practice of                
 transporting and harboring illegal aliens;           
       4. "sneak and peak" searches, pursuant         
 to Section 213 of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, unless     
 the search is authorized in accordance with          
 the laws of the State of Missouri and unless         
 searches are executed upon any resident of           
 the City of St. Louis by search warrant with         
 advance or simultaneous notice, and refrain          
 from participating in a joint search with any

 that such notice will be provided to such            
 individuals during the search; and                   
       5. establishing or maintaining an anti-

 electronic record on an individual unless            
 subject to regulations that provide for the          
 protection of individuals who are the subject        
 of unfounded reports; and                            
      6. without having, or being provided,           
 evidence showing a reasonable suspicion of           
 criminal activity:

       FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Board

 apparent violation of any city ordinance or

      WHEREAS                                      
       1.     Section 623 of the Cable             
 Communications Policy Act of 1984, 47             
 U.S.C.  543, as amended by the Cable              
 Consumer Protection and Competition Act           
 of 1992 ("Cable Act"), allows local franchise     
 authorities to regulate certain cable television  
 rates in accordance with rules and procedures     
 established by the Federal Communications         
 Commission (FCC); and                             
       2. The Board of Aldermen of the City of     
 St. Louis, Missouri ("City"), is the Franchise    
 Authority under the City Charter; is              
 empowered by Ordinance to consider and            
 decide cable-related issues; adopted on June      
 11, 1993, Board Resolution #47 authorizing        
 its Petition for Certification and Local Rules    
 for Rate Regulation; and is duly certified by     
 the FCC to regulate certain rates including       
 those for the Basic Service Tier (BST),           
 monthly equipment rentals, the hourly service     
 charge (HSC), and installation fees based on      
 the HSC, included in the Form 1205                
 ("equipment rates"); and                          
       3. The Communications Division holds        
 duties delegated by the Board of Aldermen as      
 its Franchise Agency with respect to cable        
 matters under Cable Regulatory Ordinance          
 65431, Section Thirty-Two, and the Agency         
 is required under local rules to submit a report  
 and recommendation on rate proposals to the       
 Board; and                                        
      4.      Charter       Communications         
 Entertainment I, LLC, doing business as           
 Charter Communications ("Charter") and            
 franchised to operate a cable system in the       
 City of St. Louis in accordance with terms of     
 a transfer of ownership from AT&T               
 Broadband on June 30, 2001 and its franchise    
 renewal agreement with the City of St. Louis    
 effective May 23, 2002, has submitted to the    
 City FCC Form 1240, "Updating Maximum           
 Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable             
 Services," and its associated FCC Form 1205,    
 "Determining Regulated Equipment and            
 Installation Costs" ("Equipment Form") both     
 dated October 15, 2003 (the "Rate Filing");     
      5. The Rate Filing from Charter            
 calculates a decrease in the maximum permitted  
 rates ("MPR") Charter may charge City           
 subscribers for "Basic" cable service, and      
 increases in the MPRs for hourly service        
 charge (HSC), equipment rental, and activities  
 including various types of installations, re-   
 connections and changes in service); and        
       6. At the same time as the Rate Filing,   
 Charter also submitted a third rate form, FCC   
 Form 1235, "Abbreviated Cost of Service         
 Filing For Cable Network Upgrades," seeking     
 to recover from subscribers to the Basic Service
 Tier (BST) costs associated with its current    
 cable system upgrade, totaling $3.49 monthly    
 per subscriber for the next ten years, in       
 addition to the amount calculated in the Form   
 1240 rate; and                                  
      11. FCC rules (47 C.F.R. 76.937(a))        
 place the burden on the cable operator to       
 prove that its rates for basic service and      
 equipment are reasonable under applicable       
 federal law and regulations; and                
       12. FCC rules require that the cable      
 operator follow the FCC's rules and             
 instructions with regard to preparation of Form 
 1240, Form 1205 and Form 1235, presenting       
 adequate support and documentation to           
 justify the operator's proposed MPR; and        
       13. To the extent Charter fails to carry  
 its burden of proof, the City may order Charter 
 to reduce its rates and provide refunds based   
 on the information submitted by Charter and     
 on the best available information from other    
 sources; and                                    
      14. The Franchise Agency, having           
 identified certain problems, omissions, and     
 discrepancies in the Filings and supporting     
 documentation as filed by Charter, sought legal 
 and technical assistance in reviewing and       
 analyzing the Rate Filing; and                  
      15. FCC rules allow the Local Franchise    
 Authority to (a) seek additional information    
 and supporting documentation from the cable     
 operator; (b) evaluate the correctness and      
 reasonableness of those submissions; (c) use    
 the most reliable data available to determine   
 an MPR; and (d) in the context of the best      
 information available, reasonably set maximum   
 permitted rates different from those calculated 
 by the Operator; and                            
      16. The Agency has actively sought          
additional information from Charter regarding     
the basis for its rate calculations and afforded  
Charter ample opportunity to respond to its       
written Requests for Information regarding the    
Filings; and                                      
     27. Charter has been afforded prior          
opportunity to comment and has provided           
comment on the rates recommended by the           
Agency for this Order and the proposed rate       
order was available for public comment prior      
to adoption;                                      
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                         
RESOLVED THAT , with regard to regulated          
rates in the City of St. Louis, the Board of      
Alderman orders rates as follows, for the         
reasons discussed below, as also outlined in      
the Staff and Consultant Reports:                 
      BASIC SERVICE TIER RATE                     
                 Discussion                       
      17. Because Charter's Form 1240 Filing      
corrected many of the problems identified in      
the previous year's filing, review of the Form    
1240 Filing by the City's technical consultant,   
Front Range Consulting, Inc. ("FRC"),             
revealed only one significant area of concern,    
that of programming costs, as indicated in        
FRC's Final Report on the Rate for Basic          
Service in the City of St. Louis by Charter       
Communications, Inc., submitted on January        
2, 2004 ("FRC 1240 Report"), at p. 4; and         
     18. FCC regulations allow a cable            
operator to pass through to subscribers in its    
BST rate the net programming costs the            
operator pays to programmers for channels         
appearing on the BST; and                         
      19. Under a multi-year programming          
contract with Hallmark, Charter received          
"launch support" money from Hallmark for          
the change from part-time carriage to full-time   
carriage of the Hallmark Channel, which           
effectively reduced the cost of that channel to   
Charter (FRC 1240 Report at 5); and               
     20. FRC's review of the terms of this        
contract, which were not available last year,     
allowed FRC to make more precise its              
determination of the proper offset of these       
launch support payments against                   
programming costs, consistent with FCC            
regulations (FRC 1240 Report at 5-6); and         
     21. FRC also identified and corrected        
minor problems with programming costs of          
two other channels, Weatherscan Local and         
TV Guide (FRC 1240 Report at 6-7); and            
     22. The problem with Weatherscan             
Local depended upon factual issues regarding      
the price actually paid by Charter under a        
contract document that appears to have been       
 amended by hand in some but not other             
 versions (FRC 1240 Report at 7) and with          
 TV Guide, the ability of Charter to avail itself  
 of two programming discounts (FRC Report          
 at 6); and                                        
       23. An affidavit from Charter's senior      
 programming official would provide a              
 reasonably reliable way to resolve the specific   
 factual issue involving Weatherscan Local and     
 TV Guide, which appears to have an effect of      
 approximately one cent on the BST rate; and       
 for various reasons, Charter chose not to         
 provide such an affidavit, with the result that   
 the best available information indicates that     
 the correct BST rate is the $10.48 rate listed    
 on page 3 of the FRC 1240 Report; and             
       25. Because it was necessary to             
 recalculate Charter's BST rate, FRC correctly     
 used the most current inflation data as of the    
 date of recalculation (January 2, 2004),          
 pursuant to FCC rules; and                        
      26. The conclusions of the FRC 1240          
 Report appear to be reasonable and to be based    
 on the best available information; and            
       28. The Board of Aldermen finds that        
 Charter has not met its burden of proof in        
 supporting and justifying its proposed            
 Maximum Permitted Rate of $10.54 for the          
 Basic Service Tier for the period January         
 29,.2004 through January 28, 2005, and that       
 adjustments to the Form 1240 Filing are           
 necessary, based on the City's assessment of      
 the information provided and not provided         
 by Charter since October 15, 2003.                
       29. The Board of Aldermen finds that        
 the descriptions, methodologies and               
 calculations in the FRC 1240 Report are the       
 best available basis for setting the BST rate,    
 and finds FRC's recalculation and                 
 recommendations for Charter's maximum             
 permitted rate to be reasonable and               
 appropriate.                                      
                Approved Rate                      
        30. For the period beginning February      
 1, 2004, the Board of Aldermen hereby             
 approves the following maximum permitted          
 rate (exclusive of applicable franchise fees and  
 sales taxes, but inclusive of the Regulatory      
 Fee charged to Charter by the FCC, which is       
 listed separately on Charter's subscriber bills   
 in the City) in accordance with the rates         
 calculated and recommended in the FRC 1240        
 Report as the maximum rate that can be            
 charged for the BST:                              
      BASIC SERVICE TIER                           
      MAXIMUM PERMITTED                            
      RATE............................. $ 10.48    
      To the extent that any further change in     
 the BST rate may be permitted pursuant to         
 FCC regulations, Charter shall provide             
 separate notice and explanation of such change     
 pursuant to applicable law.                        
              Future Rate Filings                   
       38. Charter shall use the $ 10.48 M P R      
 set in this Order as its starting point in carrying
 out the BST rate calculations in its next rate     
 filing, including $1.3144 external and $0.09       
 markup costs. Charter shall also use $10.48        
 as the actual rate charged for purposes of         
 Worksheet 8 in their next 1240 filing for the      
 period from October 2003 through March             
 2004 or until Charter separately itemizes the      
 BST rate from the Form 1235 Network                
 Upgrade Rate, whichever is later.                  
             EQUIPMENT AND                          
           INSTALLATION RATES                       
                   Discussion                       
       27. The Agency and its advisors              
 disagreed with Charter's capitalization of         
 certain installation labor on Form 1205            
 Schedule A, reviewed Charter's re-statement        
 of certain capitalized labor costs for 2002 and    
 sought further information from Charter with       
 which to correctly apportion such labor costs      
 on Schedule B.                                     
       28. The Agency's advisors have outlined      
 in the FRC Report reasons for a reduction in       
 the MPR for the Hourly Service Charge (HSC)        
 from Charter's proposed $26.95 to the Agency       
 recommended $25.00.                                
       29. The Agency and FRC requested             
 additional information and documentation           
 from Charter to further explain and support        
 Charter calculation of the amounts of time         
 needed to complete different specific types        
 of installations or changes on service listed in   
 Step B of Form 1205, and compared field            
 information obtained by City Inspectors to         
 verify the applicability of such time frames.      
 Based on the initial review of Charter's           
 Installation charge support calculations and       
 data obtained independently from the field ,       
 FRC concluded that the average times listed        
 for individual installation activities appear to   
 be too lengthy and not adequately supported.       
       FRC's review also concluded that             
 separately listed activities and costs for VCR     
 connection (not requiring a separate trip) or      
 amplifier installations to maintain signal         
 quality, were already covered in other types       
 of Charter installations or activities. FRC        
 believes that approval of Charter's proposed       
 rates for these items wold to lead to double       
 recovery of costs.                                 
         Maximum Permitted Rates                    
      xx. For the period from February 1, 2004      
 through January 31, 2005 the Board of              
Aldermen hereby orders that the Hourly              
Service Charge is $ 25.00, and Maximum              
Permitted Rates for various equipment rentals       
and installation activities are as follows          
(exclusive of franchise fee) :

                 Discussion                         
      Charter's Form 1205 calculated a $3.49        
monthly rate per subscriber to recover the          
cost of its system upgrade in the City of St.       
Louis over a 10 year period. After inquires         
from the City and re-calculation of certain         
entries, Charter filed a revised Form 1205          
indicating a $3.17 monthly rate in addition to      
the Basic Service Tier Rate.                        
      Such rate calculations are derived in part    
from rules and formulas established by the          
Federal Communications Commission for               
other types of cost-of-service filings. A           
number of complex issues must be resolved in        
properly applying the rules and cost                
allocations in the case of a Form 1235 filing.      
     The Agency and its advisors have               
reviewed the filing itself, the FCC's rules, as     
 well as Charter's projections as to potential    
 revenues on an upgraded system from              
 subscriber rates and other sources.              
       The following items cause the Agency       
 and its Advisors to recommend a figure lower     
 than the $3.17 amount filed by Charter to        
 avoid over-recovery of Charter's costs during    
 the life of the upgraded facilities:             
       a) Charter included in its $3.17 BST       
 calculation upgrade costs associated with the    
 introduction / maintenance of new digital and    
 other two-way services. Properly, these          
 should be excluded from the BST calculation      
 (or directly assigned to the cost non-regulated  
 services);                                       
       b) Charter has claimed there are no        
 savings in maintenance and repair costs as a     
 result of new plant facilities, substantial      
 reduction in the amount of amplifiers and        
 aerial cable;                                    
       c) Charter's filing significantly          
 overstated the projected annual electric power   
 costs in its filing                              
       d) Charter's filing significantly          
 understated the potential for additional non-    
 subscriber revenues, by projecting there would   
 be no increase whatsoever in advertising, home   
 shopping, leased access revenues, over the       
 10 year period from 2004 to 2014. The FRC        
 report notes both modest growth projections      
 cited in industry publications.                  
      e) Charter's filing did not address the     
 revenue impact from the provision of new         
 and enhanced services on an upgraded system.     
       f) The FRC calculation took into account   
 documented previous non-BST revenue              
 increases in 2003 and 2004 which are directly    
 attributable to additional capacity on the       
 system.                                          
         Maximum Permitted Rate                   
      The Board adopts the recommendation         
 of FRC in its 2004 Report that $0.75 be          
 approved as the monthly MPR derived from         
 Form 1235, for the maximum 120 month             
 recovery period, beginning October 1, 2003.      
      IMPLEMENTATION OF RATES                     
      31. The rates set herein are subject to     
 further reduction and refund (to the extent      
 permitted under applicable law and regulations   
 as the same may be amended from time to          
 time).                                           
       32. Charter shall not charge any rate      
 higher than the rates set herein, nor increase   
 that rate, nor impose on subscribers any other   
 charge for basic service and equipment not       
 specified herein, including but not limited to   
 bulk and commercial rates (to the extent such    
 limitation is permitted by applicable law),     
 unless such charge is first filed with and      
 approved by the City, in accordance with        
 applicable law and regulations, including but   
 not limited to the notice requirements imposed  
 by 47 C.F.R.76.1603, or as otherwise            
 expressly permitted under applicable law and    
 regulations.                                    
       33. Charter may charge rates less than    
 a MPR indicated above, as long as such rates    
 ar e applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory 
 way, pursuant to applicable federal, state, and 
 local laws and regulations.                     
      Rates ordered herein shall be              
 implemented on subscriber bills no later than   
 30 days from the date of this Order.            
      Refunds, if any, shall be made in          
 accordance with 47 C.F.R.  76.942(d) and        
 Section Eight of Resolution #47, and shall      
 include interest computed at applicable rates   
 published by the Internal Revenue Service for   
 tax refunds and additional tax payments,        
 pursuant to 47 C.F.R.  76.942(e).               
       36. Within thirty days from the date of   
 this Order, Charter shall file with the Agency  
 a certification, signed by an authorized        
 representative of Charter, stating whether      
 Charter has complied fully with all provisions  
 of this Order, describing measures taken to     
 implement the rates specified in this Order.    
                    OTHER                        
      39. The findings herein are based on the   
 representations of Charter.          Should     
 information come to the City's attention that   
 these representations were inaccurate in any    
 material way, the City reserves the right to    
 take appropriate action. This Order is not to   
 be construed as a finding that the City has     
 accepted as correct any specific entry,         
 explanation or argument made by Charter not     
 specifically addressed herein.                  
       40. The City reserves all of its rights   
 with respect to rate regulation, including, but 
 not limited to, any right it may have to reopen 
 this rate proceeding based on new information   
 or rulings by governing authority, if it appears
 that such new information or rulings could      
 alter the reasonable rates prescribed by FCC    
 regulations, and any right the City may have    
 to "true up" overcharges or undercharges in     
 connection with future rate filings pursuant    
 to 47 C.F.R. ? 76.922(e)(3).                    
      41. This Order shall be effective          
 immediately upon its approval by the Board      
 of Aldermen. The rates set herein will govern   
 Charter's basic service rates until Charter     
 lawfully implements a further rate change       
 pursuant to applicable FCC regulations. This    
 Order constitutes the written decision required 
by 47 C.F.R.  ?76.936(a) and shall be released     
to the public and to Charter, and a public notice  
shall be published stating that this Order has     
been issued and is available for review,           
pursuant to 47 C.F.R. ? 76.936(b).
