     RHONDA HAMM-NIEBRUEGGE                        
      WHEREAS, on Good Friday, April 22,           
 2011, at about 8:10 p.m. a category EF-3 (up      
 to 165 mph winds) tornado ripped through          
 Lambert - St. Louis International Airport as      
 well as the surrounding community of              
 Bridgeton, which was walloped with an EF-4        
 tornado, leaving in its wake extreme              
 devastation and an airport with indescribable     
 damage, including blown out windows in            
 Terminal #1, roof damage to Concourse C,          
 and broken glass everywhere; and                  
      WHEREAS, fortunately no life was lost,       
 but there was devastating property damage;        
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, in the wake of the                 
 maelstrom there are many accounts of heroism      
 and good neighborliness, including the joint      
 actions of the City of St. Louis and St. Louis    
 County, Mr. Richard Bradley (President of         
 the Board of Public Service), and the team        
 effort of all staff and volunteers at the airport;
 and                                               
      WHEREAS, in the midst of all of this         
 stormy tumult, Ms. RHONDA HAMM-                   
NIEBRUEGGE, stood tall as the Director of         
our fine airport, fielding dozens of questions    
and leading a team that found a way to reopen     
the airport to arriving flights within 24 hours,  
field departing flights within 36 hours and       
return to almost normal service within 92         
hours; and                                        
       WHEREAS, if things had turned out less     
satisfactorily, you can bet that St. Louis would  
still be making news headlines for its crippled   
airport, but instead our front door to the world  
and tourist industry, while still scarred from    
the trauma of Good Friday's twister, has a        
very visible "welcome mat" out once again,        
thanks to the team effort of Mayor Francis G.     
Slay, County Executive Charles Dooley,            
Richard Bradley, Director of the Board of         
Public Service, the legions of airport workers    
and volunteers, and the very capable              
leadership of the St. Louis - Lambert             
International Airport Director, RHONDA            
HAMM-NIEBRUEGGE; and                              
     WHEREAS, perhaps prophetically,              
RHONDA HAMM-NIEBRUEGGE, was                       
quoted as the Managing Director of the then       
St. Louis hub for American Airlines in a July     
26, 2004, St. Louis Post Dispatch article as      
saying: "The worst day out here is sometimes      
my best day."                                     
      NOW THEREFORE IT BE                         
RESOLVED that we pause in our

loss of life in this devastating tornado. We      
pray for those who are homeless and suffering     
from this horrific storm. We recognize and        
applaud the heroic acts of all the team who       
worked mightily to recover from the damage        
wrought, including the devastation at Lambert     
- St. Louis International Airport. We             
especially, note and appreciate the confident

Director,         RHONDA             HAMM-        
NIEBRUEGGE. We further direct the Clerk

 newest Americans, they offer St. Louis the

 expanding our community's ability to reach       
 out and build a stronger global market for St.   
 Louis' goods and services; and                   
     WHEREAS, the young Somalis who will

 Among other factors, the Board will consider

 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and             
 associated Regulations could apply to the          
 service for which bids are being sought herein.    
 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,         
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.    
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration          
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration   
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.  
 A successful bidder's failure to comply with       
 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.                                       
       Copies of the Ordinance and Regulations      
 are available upon request from Carol Shepard,     
 at 314-444-5608 or can be accessed at              
 http://www.stlouiscity.com/livingwage.             
      Bidders are also advised that the State       
 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.        
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the       
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or        
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than    
 the prevailing rate for any work done under        
 the contract by the contractor or by any           
 subcontractor (Section 290.250, RSMo.).            
 Also, if a vendor would like to receive a bid
