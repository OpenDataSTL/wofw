St. Raphael the Archangel Parish                      
     60th Church Anniversary                          
    WHEREAS, on June 24, 1950,                        
 Archbishop Joseph E. Ritter appointed Fr.          
 Arthur G. Behrman to organize a new parish         
 in the southwest corner of St. Louis and the       
 adjacent area of the county. The official          
 groundbreaking ceremony took place on              
 January 21, 1951, with the school as the first     
 priority. On September 12, 1951, St. Raphael       
 School opened for 340 students with the            
 School Sisters off Notre Dame as the faculty.      
 On August 15, 1951 Fr. Behrman blessed the         
 cornerstone for the church portion of the          
 school complex (now the gym). The church           
 (seating 600) was quickly built, and it was        
 blessed on January 26, 1952 with the first         
 Mass celebrated on January 27. In 1956 the         
 Archdiocese altered the parish boundaries with     
 the area on the west side of River Des Peres       
 becoming part of the newly formed St.              
 Dominic Savio parish. At the time of the           
 division, St. Raphael had about 750 families       
 and 290 children in the school.                    
       WHEREAS, in 1965 Fr. Behrman                 
 received permission to begin building a new        
 church and attached rectory. Construction          
 for the 750 seat church began in the summer        
 of 1966. The formal laying of the cornerstone      
 occurred on October 23, 1966. The official         
 opening of the church took place on Sunday,        
 November 5, 1967; and Archbishop John J.           
 Carberry officially dedicated the church on        
 April 28, 1968.                                    
       WHEREAS, following the death of              
 Msgr. Behrman in 1971, Fr. Richard J.              
 Gallagher came to St. Raphael as pastor and        
 served for seventeen years. Msgr. Gallagher        
 oversaw the transition from a religious to a       
 lay faculty for the school.                        
       WHEREAS, in 1988 Fr. William A.              
 Drennan became the third pastor of the parish      
 and also served for seventeen years. In 2001       
 the parish launched a capital campaign to          
 expand the school by four classrooms, install      
 an elevator for handicapped accessibility, and     
 add new office space and new, large restrooms.     
 Construction began in August 2002 and              
 proceeded quickly. On September 14                 
 Archbishop Justin Regali blessed the newly         
 completed additions.                               
       WHEREAS, today under the leadership          
 of the new pastor, Msgr. Henry J. Breier, the      
 parish will offer a pre-school program and         
 before and after care, beginning in the fall. The  
 parish boasts 569 families and the projected       
 fall enrollment for the school is 194.             
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our         
 deliberations to recognize the 60th

 This Ordinance requires that, unless specific      
 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform      
 work pursuant to a contract executed between       
 the successful bidder and the City must be         
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage       
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term    
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,

 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage           
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration

 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.

 the contract provisions related to the Living      
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of        
 the contract and the imposition of additional      
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and          
 Regulations.

     Bidders are also advised that the State        
 of Missouri requires workers on all public         
 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.    
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the   
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or    
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than
 the prevailing rate for any work done under    
 the contract by the contractor or by any
