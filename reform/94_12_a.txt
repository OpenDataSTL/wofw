 Introduced on the 3rd day of June, 2011 by:       
 Honorable Samuel L. MooreAlderman 4th Ward        
           Resolution No. 107                      
  25th Anniversary of Circus Flora                 
     WHEREAS, we have been apprised that           
 Circus Flora is celebrating its 25th              
 Anniversary this year; and                        
       WHEREAS, Circus Flora combines the          
 magic of a one ring circus with theater           
 techniques, an ensemble cast and a story line     
 to create a "magical theater in a sawdust ring."  
 For the past 25 years, Circus Flora has had its   
 audiences delighted with laughter.....gasping     
 with astonishment.....and on its feet with        
 applause! Once you experience Circus Flora,       
 they know they will touch something in each       
 of us that will keep us enchanted for years to    
 come; and                                         
      WHEREAS, Gian Carlo Menotti                  
 originally commissioned Circus Flora for the      
 1986 Spoleto Festival USA. Based on the           
 overwhelmingly positive response at its           
 debut, Artistic Director/Producer, Ivor David     
 Balding, together with Sheila and Sam Jewell      
 and Alexandre Sacha Pavlata, established          
 Circus Flora in 1987 as a permanent               
 performing arts organization in St. Louis; and    
       WHEREAS, established as a theater           
 company, Circus Flora specialized in an           
 ensemble, one-ring circus - performed in a big    
 top tent - accessible and affordable for all.     
 This new performing arts organization set out     
 to acquaint audiences with the joy and power      
 of the classic, European-style circus; and        
       WHEREAS, Flora, for which the Circus        
 is named, is an orphaned elephant that Balding    
 rescued when her mother was killed by ivory       
 poachers in Africa. For fifteen years, Flora      
 was a beloved star of the Circus. In 2000,        
 Flora retired from stage life and currently     
 resides in the elephant sanctuary in            
 Hohenwald, Tennessee; and                       
       WHEREAS, Circus Flora was a hit from      
 the very beginning. Not content with a          
 traditional circus, Balding set out to create a 
 new formula - weaving separate acts together    
 by the common thread of an engaging             
 storyline; and                                  
        WHEREAS, original, live music and a      
 narrative frame the acts, bringing animals and  
 people together in a unique celebration of life.
 By integrating classic traditions of the circus 
 with theater techniques, an ensemble cast and   
 a storyline, Circus Flora produces              
 mesmerizing shows that consistently deliver     
 wonder and amazement to audience members        
 of all ages; and                                
       WHEREAS, the ensemble company             
 mixes the best of world-class, family-based     
 circus knowledge, passed down from              
 generation to generation, with actors, dancers, 
 musicians and animals, as well as performers    
 from the new circus street and vaudeville       
 movements. The artistry, magic and charm of     
 Circus Flora's performances have made it part   
 of the vanguard of the "new circus" movement    
 in North America; and                           
       WHEREAS,             adding to the        
 distinctiveness and richness of the community,  
 St. Louis is fortunate to be one of only three  
 cities in the country with a circus of its very 
 own. Each June, Circus Flora pitches the big    
 red top tent on the Powell Symphony Hall        
 parking lot to offer St. Louisans an amazing    
 production of world-class performances; and     
       WHEREAS, year after year, Circus          
 Flora's momentum continues to grow. The         
 2010 season brought 29,500 fans to the big      
 top. In 1997, Circus Flora's big top tent was   
 the first ever to be erected at the Kennedy     
 Center in Washington, D.C.; and in 2002, the    
 tent was raised at The Lincoln Center Festival  
 in New York City. Additionally, the Circus      
 has made an unprecedented six appearances       
 at the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston,      
 South Carolina.                                 
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

 Anniversary of Circus Flora and we further

 proceedings and to prepare a commemorative      
 copy to the end that it may be presented to

           employee, the living wage rate is      
           $11.58 per hour (130% of the federal   
           poverty level income guideline for a   
           family of three); and
