            Resolution No. 260                      
           Susan C. Lauritsen                       
      WHEREAS, Whereas, Susan C.                    
 Lauritsen has been a Park Ranger for the City      
 of St. Louis for five years and ten months.        
 She was hired on February 7, 2005; and             
       WHEREAS, on November 22, 2010 at             
 1:29AM, Ranger Lauritsen entered the eastern       
 section of Fairgrounds Park at Natural Bridge      
 and N. Grand. Crossing Vandeventer, she            
 continued onto the interior road along the         
 north side of the lake. Noticing a car driving     
 along the south side of the lake, she turned her   
 spotlight on and began following the vehicle.      
 As she reached the south side of the lake, she     
 could no longer see the car. Using her spotlight,  
 she located the vehicle around the side of the     
 bridge, submerged in the lake; and                 
       WHEREAS, Ranger Lauritsen                    
 immediately called for police back up.             
 Approaching the car, she saw that it was           
 occupied by one adult male who was in the          
 driver's seat with his window down. He was         
 conscious and began waving for help. At this       
 point the water level inside the car was above     
 his shoulders but had not yet reached his face;    
 and                                                
       WHEREAS, Ranger Lauritsen assured            
 the man that help was on its way, but as several   
 minutes passed the rear of the car began to        
 sink. With the water level reaching his chin,      
 the driver began to panic. After radioing her      
 superior, Ranger Lauritsen removed her duty        
 belt and wallet and courageously waded into        
 the lake to rescue the citizen; and                
       WHEREAS, Ranger Lauritsen, upon              
 arriving at the car, observed that the occupant    
 appeared to be severely intoxicated and didn't     
 know how to get out of the car. Ranger             
 Lauritsen told him to open the door, and he        
 said he couldn't get out. Ranger Lauritsen         
 checked to see if the man's seat belt was          
 buckled. Learning that it was unsecured, she       
 ordered him to get out but he did not respond.     
 With the water level continuing to rise, Ranger    
 Lauritsen opened the car door and grabbed          
 the man by his jacket, pulling him out. Ranger     
 Lauritsen had to support the man as they           
 walked to land. The man was later transported      
 by paramedics to Barnes Hospital; and               
      WHEREAS, Ranger Lauritsen then                 
 helped to coordinate the Fire Department            
 water rescue team and City Tow in hauling           
 the vehicle from the lake.                          
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our          
 deliberations to note the heroism shown by          
 Park Ranger Susan C. Lauritsen in the               
 performance of her duties on November 22,           
 2010. Her awareness, courage, and prompt            
 action on the job resulted in the saving of a       
 man's life and serves as an example of the fine     
 and unsung service provided by countless            
 employees of the City of St. Louis everyday,        
 and we further direct the Clerk of this Board       
 to spread a copy of this Resolution across the      
 minutes of these proceedings and to prepare a       
 commemorative copy to the end that it may
