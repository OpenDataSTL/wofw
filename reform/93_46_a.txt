           Housing Corporation                    
       WHEREAS, the all-volunteer Soulard         
 Community Housing Corporation was                
 incorporated in 1989, following the              
 designation by the City as one of the first      
 thirteen "Operation Conserv" neighborhoods.      
 9th Ward Alderman Martie Aboussie and 7th

renovated one of the oldest structures in        
Soulard called "The Trapper's Cottage." That     
building, along with the rehab of two other      
historic homes and construction of two infill    
units, completed a long abandoned block; and

group of dedicated volunteers has acquired

neighborhood. Most recently, the wonderful       
homes at 3306 S. 9th, 3312 S. 9th, and 900       
Utah were transformed with the hard work of      
the dedicated volunteers of the Soulard          
Community Housing Corporation; and               
      WHEREAS, as it prepared to cease           
operation, the Soulard Community Housing         
Corporation has taken revenues generated by      
the sale of these properties and contributed     
to assist other not-for-profits and to make      
direct improvements in neighborhood projects     
such as wrought iron fencing around Soulard      
Market Park, a new furnace for the Soulard       
School, and a new roof for the American Legion.

            Resolution No. 303                         
 National Girls & Women in Sports Day                  
      WHEREAS, Girls Incorporated, Girl                
 Scouts of the USA, the National Association           
 for Girls and Women in Sport, the National            
 Women's Law Center, and the Women's                   
 Sports Foundation join together to celebrate          
 the 24th Annual National Girls and Women in           
 Sports Day in Washington, D.C. and                    
 communities across the nation; and                    
      WHEREAS, this day exists to                      
 acknowledge the past and recognize current            
 sports achievements, the positive influence           
 of sports participation, and the continuing           
 struggle for equality and access for women in         
 sports; and                                           
      WHEREAS, National Girls and Women                
 in Sports Day began in 1987 as a day to               
 remember Olympic volleyball player, Flo               
 Hyman, for her athletic achievements and her          
 commitment to assure equality for women's             
 sports; and                                           
      WHEREAS, the history of girls and                
 women in sports is rich and long, yet there           
 has been little national recognition of the           
 significance of girls and women's athletic            
 achievements; and                                     
       WHEREAS, girls' and women's                     
 athletics, at all levels, is one of the most

 and women in the United States may develop       
 self-discipline, initiative, confidence, and     
 leadership skills regardless of background; and  
       WHEREAS, the bonds built between           
 girls and women through athletics help to        
 break down the social barriers of racism and     
 prejudice, and the communication and             
 cooperation skills learned play a key role in    
 the athlete's contributions at home, at work     
 and to society; and                              
       WHEREAS, a need for increased              
 opportunities exists for girls to participate in 
 and pursue physical activity at the community    
 and scholastic level to increase their health    
 and well-being on a daily basis so that they     
 are able to develop lifelong fitness habits at an
 early age; and                                   
        WHEREAS, this year's theme is "Play       
 On."                                             
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 Program and exceeded the parish goal for the     
 Archdiocesan Stewardship Campaign in the         
 early 1990's; and                                
      WHEREAS, Mrs. Brown has received            
 numerous awards of recognition for civic

        WHEREAS, the goal of the National        
 Children's Study is not to be intrusive, but    
 rather is to improve the health and well-being

     WHEREAS, grouped findings (nothing            
identifying individuals) from the National         
Children's Study will be made available as the     
study progresses, making potential benefits        
known to the public as soon as possible; and       
      WHEREAS, the National Children's             
Study will be one of the richest research efforts  
geared towards learning about children's health    
and development and will form the basis of         
child health guidance, interventions, and policy   
for generations to come.                           
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT
