     WHEREAS, on July 26, 1990, President           
George H.W. Bush signed into law the                
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to            
ensure the civil rights of people with              
disabilities. This legislation established a clear  
and comprehensive national mandate for the          
elimination of discrimination against               
individuals with disabilities; and                  
      WHEREAS, The ADA has expanded                 
opportunities for Americans with disabilities       
by reducing barriers, changing perceptions, and     
increasing full participation in community life.    
 However, the full promise of the ADA will             
 only be reached if public entities remain             
 committed in their efforts to fully implement         
 the ADA; and

 principles of equality and inclusion and              
 recommitting our efforts to reach full ADA            
 Compliance.

       21 st Annual World AIDS Day                     
       WHEREAS, in light of alarming                   
 statistics regarding St. Louis' rates on HIV,         
 Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region            
 (PPSLR) and members of the City of St. Louis          
 Board of Aldermen will promote the                    
 importance of STD testing and knowing your            
 status to keep our community healthy and              
 safe; and

 Annual World AIDS Day, St. Louis leaders

 getting tested regularly to combat our city's         
 high rates of HIV and other STDs such as              
 Chlamydia and Gonorrhea. According to the             
 CDC, St. Louis ranks #5 in HIV and #2 in

 regards St. Louis as an "at risk" city; and         
      WHEREAS, more than one million                 
 Americans are infected with HIV, and more           
 than 20 percent do not know it, making it           
 very likely that they may be unknowingly            
 infecting others; and                               
       WHEREAS, Planned Parenthood is                
 offering free HIV tests on December 1 at any        
 of their six area health centers to promote early   
 detection of the disease. Many members of           
 the City of St. Louis Board of Aldermen will        
 be receiving their annual HIV test to show          
 that not only should testing be routine, but it     
 is also easy and painless.                          
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT

      WHEREAS, in 1977 Evangelist Sanders           
 became a member of the body of Christ and as       
 a result has been a faithful steward               
 demonstrating love, exemplifying holiness, and     
 leading many to Christ; and                        
      WHEREAS, Evangelist Sanders has               
 ministered to hundreds and perhaps thousands       
 through her music ministry, and through her        
 preaching and teaching ministry causing            
 healing and deliverance in the lives of God's      
 people; and                                        
      WHEREAS, Evangelist Sanders has               
 been steadfast, standing in the gap for the        
 ministry, the community, and the body of           
 Christ at large. Her angelic smile and warm        
 hug brings healing to ones soul assuring all       
 that everything is going to be alright and that 
 God will take care of you. She exhorts all to   
 "clap your hands all ye people, and shout       
 unto the Lord with a voice of triumph"; and     
      WHEREAS, triumphant she is. In 2003        
 she was given an even greater task when         
 Bishop W. L. Fitzpatrick crowned her with       
 the distinct honor of Co- Pastor of Faith       
 United Assembly of the Living God; and          
       WHEREAS, as you can see, her past         
 has not reflected who she is, it has only been  
 a stepping stone to what God has made her, a    
 great woman of God and a blessing to this       
 ministry.

 Clerk of this Board to spread a copy of this

       Pastor Hilliard Fitzpatrick               
       WHEREAS, when it comes to Pastor          
 Hilliard Fitzpatrick, there is more than meets  
 the eye. Pastor Fitzpatrick is not just a leader
 and humble servant of God but a visionary       
 and transformation agent with a big heart to    
 impact not only this ministry but communities   
 all over this country; and                      
        WHEREAS, Pastor Hilliard Fitzpatrick     
 was licensed in 1987, ordained 1994, and began  
 pastoring in 1996. In 2006, he began            
 ministering all over the country in churches,   
 schools and colleges teaching and preaching     
 godly principles. Additionally, Pastor Hilliard 
 worked with the Saint Louis City Police         
 Department Task Force to address and reduce     
 violent crimes in St. Louis City. His desire is 
 to let the community know that we are here      
 to love, to help, and to comfort; and           
       WHEREAS, Pastor Fitzpatrick feels         
 God wants to transform churches, cities, and    
 nations in our generation. He feels the sense   
 of mission to inspire hope in the hearts of     
 leaders and churches to not only believe God    
 can transform their churches and cities but     
 that he will; and                               
       WHEREAS, as history would have it,        
 overcoming life's limitations and spiritual     
 restrictions was not enough for Pastor Hilliard 
 Fitzpatrick. He needed to make a difference     
and needed to direct people in overcoming in       
life and achieving their spiritual freedom.        
Pastor Fitzpatrick is particularly passionate      
about enriching the lives of the least, the less,  
and the lost. He has inspired us to realize that   
even "Gods faithfulness is faithful"; and          
      WHEREAS, Pastor Fitzpatrick                  
commits to serving the people "heartily as         
unto the Lord", as suggested in Colossians         
3:23. His humility shows as he takes time out      
to do the arduous, physical tasks of the           
church, the things that no one else is willing to  
do; and                                            
       WHEREAS, Pastor Fitzpatrick is              
committed to fulfilling the vision of our          
Bishop for a church where God is seen, Love        
is felt, and Lives are forever changed. He has     
been chosen to compel all to answer the call       
of the Gospel of Christ, and to be transformed     
by the indwelling power of the Holy Spirit.        
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT

 which consent shall not be unreasonably            
 withheld.

 Secured Party, to be applied in accordance         
 with the terms of the Loan Documents. Any          
 excess proceeds remaining after the Loan is        
 paid in full shall be paid to Landlord. All        
 condemnation awards are subject to Secured         
 Party's approval, and Secured Party will be        
 permitted to participate in all condemnation       
 proceedings. For the purpose of this Section       
 2.3, any action taken by Landlord pursuant         
 to Sections 9 or 10 of the Standard Provisions     
 section of the Lease shall be deemed a             
 "condemnation."                                    
 3. Foreclosure; Actions of Secured

 the Lease, go onto the Property for the            
 purpose of exercising its rights hereunder and     
 under the Loan Documents, including, without       
 limitation, foreclosing the Deed of Trust, and     
 removing or taking possession of the               
 Collateral regardless of the nature of the         
 Collateral or its relationship to the Property.    
       3.2. Landlord agrees that it will rely on    
 a certificate from Secured Party that Event of     
 Default exists.                                    
      3.3. Secured Party is at all times            
 (whether or not an Event of Default has         
 occurred) permitted to go onto the Property     
 to inspect the Collateral.                      
       3.4. Landlord agrees not to interfere     
 with or hinder Secured Party in the exercise of 
 any rights granted to Secured Party under the   
 Loan Documents, or otherwise permitted by       
 law, including, without limitation, taking any  
 action contemplated by this Section 3. Secured  
 Party agrees to repair any damage to the        
 Property which is caused by the removal of      
 Collateral or the inspection of the Property.   
       3.5. Landlord will give written notice    
 to Secured Party of the occurrence of any       
 default or event of default by Tenant under     
 the Lease at the same time Landlord gives such  
 notice to Tenant and Secured Party will have    
 the right, but not the obligation, to cure any  
 such default within ninety (90) days after its  
 receipt of such notice; provided, however, that 
 such ninety (90) day period shall be extended   
 for so long as Secured Party is either (i)      
 diligently attempting to cure such default or   
 (ii) diligently attempting to foreclose upon    
 the Deed of Trust. Landlord agrees that it      
 shall not exercise any of its rights or remedies
 as a result of any breach or default by Tenant  
 under the Lease unless Landlord has complied    
 with this Section 3.5.                          
       3.6. In the event of any termination of   
 the Lease (including, without limitation, any   
 termination pursuant to the Federal             
 Bankruptcy Code), (a) Secured Party shall       
 have the right to request that Landlord enter   
 into a new lease agreement with Secured Party   
 within forty-five (45) days after the date on   
 which Secured Party receives written notice     
 of the termination of the Lease, and (b)        
 Landlord and Secured Party shall enter into     
 such new lease agreement on the same terms      
 and conditions as the Lease, as modified by     
 this Agreement, within thirty (30) days after   
 Landlord receives Secured Party's request.      
 Such new lease shall be for the then-remaining  
 term of the Lease.                              
 4. No Assumption by Secured Party.              
 Notwithstanding anything contained herein to    
 the contrary, Landlord and Tenant agree that    
 (i) Secured Party has not assumed any duty,     
 liability or obligation of Tenant under the     
 Lease, and (ii) any payment or act done by      
 Secured Party to cure any default by, Tenant    
 under the Lease, or any action to renew or      
 extend the Lease, or Secured Party's exercise   
 of its other rights under Section 3, will not   
 constitute an assumption by Secured Party       
 of the Lease or any obligation of Tenant. In    
 addition, in the event Secured Party acquires   
 Tenant's interest in the Property, Secured      
 Party shall not be (a) liable or responsible for
 any prior act or omission of Tenant; (b)        
 subject to any claims or defenses which         
Landlord might have against Tenant; (c) liable     
or responsible for any default by Tenant under     
the Lease or obligated to cure any prior default   
by Tenant under the Lease; (d) liable or           
responsible for any agreement of Tenant to         
indemnify or defend Landlord, or to reimburse      
Landlord for any sums expended by Landlord;        
or (e) bound by any amendment to the Lease         
not approved by Secured Party in writing. In       
addition, in the event of a Foreclosure, Secured   
Party shall not be responsible or liable for       
any of the matters which are described in          
Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Standard Provisions     
section of the Lease or for any other violations   
of applicable environmental laws, codes or         
ordinances to the extent such matters or           
violations arose or occurred prior to the date     
of the Foreclosure or were existing as of the      
date of the Foreclosure. Without limitation        
of the foregoing, Secured Party shall not be       
obligated to indemnify Landlord pursuant to        
Section 5 of the Standard Provisions section       
of the Lease for any release or discharge of       
any hazardous materials on or from the             
Property if such hazardous materials are           
present on the Property as of the date of a        
Foreclosure.                                       
5. Certifications. Landlord certifies to

owner of the premises leased pursuant to the       
Lease, (ii) Tenant has complied with all of its    
construction obligations under the Lease, (iii)

of Secured Party or Tenant, Landlord agrees        
to certify that the Lease is in effect and Tenant  
is in good standing, and confirm the date of       
commencement of the Lease and the date of

 and its students are doing an excellent job at    
 raising community awareness about excessive       
 idling and reduced air pollution. This artwork    
 will be used at local bus yards and in anti-      
 idling publications and during local outreach     
 efforts; and                                      
      WHEREAS, reduced idling and the              
 implementation of the "No Idling Zones" at        
 each SLPS school will save the school district    
 thousands of dollars in fuel costs and reduce     
 asthma related school absences; and               
       WHEREAS, the St. Louis Public School        
 district uses more than 535 buses per day to      
 transport children to and from school. The        
 EPA grant that co sponsored this art contest      
 will save more than 87, 884 gallons of diesel     
 fuel per year, 454 tons of CO2, 10.4 tons of      
 NOX, 26.5 tons of particulate matter and          
 345.2 tons of hydrocarbons from entering the      
 cabs of buses and the air that students and       
 drivers directly breathe; and

 amended the City of St. Louis "No Idling"         
 ordinance to prohibit idling for more than five   
 minutes, meaning that reducing pollutants         
 means simply turning your engines off. The        
 current ordinance is ordinance #65645.            
       NOW THEREFORE IT BE

           Resolution No. 10                     
  Cleanup of the West Lake Landfill              
      WHEREAS, 66 years ago, the United          
States government began processing uranium       
for the development of nuclear weapons at        
the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works (MCW),           
near Downtown St. Louis. From 1946 until         
1957 the radioactive wastes were trucked to a    
23-acre tract at the St. Louis Airport on Brown  
Road (now McDonnell Blvd.) on the banks          
of Coldwater Creek, and were dumped there;       
 and                                                
       WHEREAS, some of those wastes were           
 later trucked to Latty Avenue in Hazelwood         
 for drying and shipping to Colorado for            
 reprocessing, with dispersal resulting along       
 the haul roads; and                                
      WHEREAS, in 1973 some of the Latty            
 Avenue wastes were illegally dumped at the         
 West Lake Municipal Waste Landfill in              
 Bridgeton, next to Earth City, in the Missouri     
 River floodplain; and                              
      WHEREAS, in 1997 Congress                     
 transferred responsibility from the U.S.           
 Department of Energy to the U.S. Army Corps        
 of Engineers for the remediation of the nation's   
 abandoned sites where work had been                
 performed for the early atomic weapons             
 program; and                                       
       WHEREAS, the Corps has been                  
 directing the cleanup of all the sites containing  
 MCW radioactive wastes in St. Louis City           
 and County, under the Formerly Utilized Sites      
 Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), except           
 for the West Lake Landfill, and expects to         
 continue employing its trained contractors and     
 personnel in St. Louis for an additional four      
 to five years; and                                 
       WHEREAS, because the U.S.                    
 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had          
 placed West Lake on its Superfund National         
 Priorities List in 1990, it therefore had assumed  
 responsibility for the landfill's wastes and       
 remediation; and                                   
       WHEREAS, the EPA issued a Record             
 of Decision in May 2008 about West Lake,           
 dictating that the radioactive wastes were to      
 remain in the landfill, with merely a cover of     
 rocks, construction rubble, and clay, and no       
 liner below to protect the wastes from             
 groundwater leaching; and                          
       WHEREAS, residents in St. Louis              
 County north of I-70 and most St. Louis City       
 residents drink water from the Missouri River,     
 downstream from West Lake.                         
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of               
 the City of St. Louis that we request that         
 Congress transfer jurisdiction over the cleanup    
 of West Lake radioactive wastes (Operable          
 Unit One) from the EPA Superfund Program           
 to the Corps of Engineers' FUSRAP and that         
 those wastes be excavated and shipped to a         
 licensed radioactive waste disposal site.          
 Furthermore, the Board of Aldermen of the          
 City of St. Louis urges all those involved in      
 the cleanup of the West Lake radioactive           
 wastes to ensure that these wastes no longer       
 migrate into the human environment, to the         
 detriment of today's and future generations.
