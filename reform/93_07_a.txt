      President Reed introduced Resolutions        
 No. 5 through 45, and 49 through 52 and the       
 Clerk was instructed to read same.                
             Resolution No. 5                      
  National Autism Awareness Month                  
      WHEREAS, we pause in our                     
 deliberations to recognize April as National      
 Autism Awareness Month; and                       
       WHEREAS, In the wake of a recent new        
 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease          
 Control(CDC) stating that autism now affects      
 1 in every 110 American children, Autism          
 Speaks, the nation's largest autism science and   
 advocacy organization, called on the federal      
 government to immediately step up its efforts     
 - and dramatically increase funding - to address  
 the growing national autism public health         
 crisis; and                                       
      WHEREAS, on December 18, 2007, the           
 United Nations General Assembly adopted           
 resolution 62/139, which supported the            
 campaign for a World Autism Awareness Day         
 through the current 62nd UN General               
 Assembly Session, garnering consensus             
 support from all United Nations Member            
 States; and                                       
       WHEREAS, World Autism Awareness             
 Day shines a bright light on autism as a growing  
 global health crisis. WAAD activities help to     
 increase and develop world knowledge of the       
 autism epidemic and impart information            
 regarding the importance of early diagnosis       
 and early intervention. Additionally, WAAD        
 celebrates the unique talents and skills of       
 persons with autism and is a day when             
 individuals with autism are warmly welcomed       
 and embraced in community events around           
 the globe; and                                    
       WHEREAS, Autism Speaks is the               
 nation's largest autism science and advocacy      
 organization. Since its inception only five       
 short years ago, Autism Speaks has made           
 enormous strides, committing over $131            
 million to research and developing innovative     
 new resources for families through 2014. The      
 organization is dedicated to funding research     
 into the causes, prevention, treatments and a     
 cure for autism; increasing awareness of autism   
 spectrum disorders; and advocating for the        
 needs of individuals with autism and their        
 families. In addition to funding research,        
 Autism Speaks also supports the Autism            
 Treatment Network, Autism Genetic                 
 Resource Exchange and several other scientific    
 and clinical programs; and                        
      WHEREAS, government statistics               
 suggest the prevalence rate of autism is          
 increasing 10-17 percent annually. There is       
 not established explanation for this increase,      
 although improved diagnosis and                     
 environmental influences are two reasons often      
 considered. Studies suggest boys are more           
 likely than girls to develop autism and receive     
 the diagnosis three to four times more              
 frequently. Current estimates are that in the       
 United States alone, one out of 70 boys is          
 diagnosed with autism.                              
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                            
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                
 the City of St. Louis that we pause to              
 recognize April as National Autism Awareness

 across the minutes of these proceedings and

 Introduced on the 23rd day of April, 2010 by:       
 HonorableTerry Kennedy,Alderman 18th Ward           
             Resolution No. 25                       
                 Tyler Perry                         
       WHEREAS, Tyler Perry's inspirational          
 journey from the hard streets of New Orleans        
 to the heights of Hollywood's A-list is the         
 stuff of American legend. Born into poverty         
 and raised in a household scarred by abuse,         
 Tyler fought from a young age to find the           
 strength, faith and perseverance that would         
 later form the foundations of his much-             
 acclaimed plays, films, books and shows; and        
       WHEREAS, it was a simple piece of             
 advice from Oprah Winfrey that set Tyler's          
 career in motion. Encouraged to keep a diary        
 of his daily thoughts and experiences, Tyler        
 began writing a series of soul-searching letters    
 to himself-letters full of pain, forgiveness, and,  
 in time, a healing catharsis. The letters inspired  
 a musical, I Know I've Been Changed, and in         
 1992 Tyler gathered his life's savings and set      
 off for Atlanta in hopes of staging it for sold     
 out crowds. He spent all the money but the          
 people never came, and Tyler once again came        
 face to face with the poverty that had plagued      
 his youth. He spent months sleeping in seedy        
 motels and his car but his faith-in God and, in     
 turn, himself-only got stronger. He forged a        
 powerful relationship with the church, and he    
 kept writing. In 1998 his perseverance paid      
 off and a promoter I Know I've Been Changed      
 for a limited run at a local church-turned-      
 theatre. This time the community came out in     
 droves, and soon the musical moved to            
 Atlanta's prestigious Fox Theatre. Tyler Perry   
 never looked back; and                           
       WHEREAS, I Know I've Been Changed          
 was a poignant story of failure and              
 redemption, and it resounded with urban          
 audiences who identified with its themes and     
 exalted in its spirit. In Tyler they'd found a   
 voice for their longings, and an outlet for their
 entertainment, and so began an incredible run    
 of eight plays in as many years, including       
 Woman Thou Art Loosed!, a celebrated             
 collaboration with the prominent Dallas pastor   
 T.D. Jakes; and                                  
       WHEREAS, but if audiences were             
 buoyed by Tyler's faith, they were bowled        
 over by his humor. No way around it: the man     
 was plain funny. Nowhere was this more in        
 evidence than in 2000's I Can Do Bad All By      
 Myself, which marked the first appearance        
 of the now-legendary Madea. A God-fearing,       
 gun-toting, pot-smoking, loud-mouthed            
 grandmother, Madea was played by Perry           
 himself. Madea was such a resounding             
 success, she soon spawned a series of plays-     
 Madea's Family Reunion (2002), Madea's           
 Class Reunion (2003) and Madea Goes to Jail      
 (2005) and set the stage for Tyler's jump to     
 the big screen; and                              
       WHEREAS, in early 2005, Tyler's first      
 feature film, Diary of a Mad Black Woman,        
 debuted at #1 nationwide. By the end of its      
 first weekend in theatres, two things had        
 happened: the film had earned $22 million,       
 and Tyler Perry-writer, actor, and producer-     
 had become a superstar. Tyler's ensuing films,   
 Madea's Family Reunion, Daddy Little Girls,      
 Why Did I Get Married?, Meet the Browns,         
 and The Family that Preys have all met with      
 massive critical and commercial success,         
 delighting audiences across America and around   
 the world. His most recent film, Madea Goes      
 to Jail, spent two weeks at the top of the box   
 office and ultimately went on to gross more      
 than $90 million; and                            
       WHEREAS, 2006 saw the publication          
 of Tyler's first book, Don't Make a Black        
 Woman Take Off Her Earrings: Madea's             
 Uninhibited Commentaries on Life and Love,       
 which shot to the top of the New York Times      
 nonfiction bestseller list and remained there    
 for eight weeks. It went on to claim Quill Book  
 Awards for both "Humor" and "Book of the         
 Year" (an unheard-of feat for a first-time       
 author), and spread Tyler Perry's unique brand   
 of inspirational entertainment to a devoted      
 new audience; and                                
      WHEREAS, tt is a brand that is quickly      
becoming an empire. In 2007, Tyler expanded       
his reach to television with the TBS series       
Tyler Perry's House of Payne, the highest-        
rated first-run syndicated cable show of all      
time, which went into syndication after only      
a year. His follow up effort, Meet the Browns,    
was the second highest debut ever on cable -      
after House of Payne - and was picked up for      
80 episodes to begin airing this summer. Not      
one to rest on success, Tyler Perry and his       
300 Atlanta-based employees are hard at work      
on new projects including I Can Do Bad All        
By Myself starring Academy Award nominee          
Taraji Henson and Mary J. Blige, currently in     
production; Why Did I Get Married Too,            
which will go into production this summer.        
He helped release Precious: Based On The          
Novel By Saphire, in conjunction with his         
34th Street Films banner, Oprah Winfrey's         
Harpo Films and Lionsgate. The film was also      
the recipient of three prestigious awards at      
the festival: Grand Jury Prize: U.S Dramatic,     
Audience Award and a Special Jury Award for       
Acting; and                                       
      WHEREAS, in the fall of 2008, Perry         
also opened his 200,000 square foot studios       
in Atlanta situated on the former Delta Airlines  
campus on more than 30 acres. Employing           
hundreds of local Atlantans, his new studio       
consists of 5 sound stages, a post production     
facility, a pond, a back lot, a 400 seat theater  
and private screening room and designated         
areas for entertaining and holding events.        
     NOW THEREFORE BE IT                          
RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of              
the City of St. Louis that we pause in our

wish him continued success, achievement and       
accomplishment and we further direct the

 Louis and other target cities and would           
 therefore significantly reduce the risk of        
 terrorism and the detrimental affects of          
 accidental releases; and                          
      WHEREAS, according to recent                 
 congressional records the Association of          
 American Railroads testified in Congress that     
 when railroads transporting toxic gas cargoes     
 travel through major cities they are "risking     
 the company" since they are uninsured for         
 the potential $10 Billion in damages that could   
 result from a major release and thus asked        
 Congress to indemnify them in the case of a       
 release; and                                      
     WHEREAS, chlorine is classified as a          
 Toxic Inhalation Hazard by the U.S.               
 Department of Homeland Security; and              
       WHEREAS, the Chlorine Institute             
 estimates that one chlorine tank car can release  
 a cloud at a potentially lethal level that extends
 15 miles downwind and 4 miles wide; and           
       WHEREAS, recent filings with the U.S.       
 Surface Transportation Board indicate clearly     
 that railroads transport many chlorine gas        
 cargoes hundreds, even thousands of miles         
 across the US, on routes some of which no         
 doubt routinely traverse the City of St. Louis;   
 and                                               
       WHEREAS, a recent statement                 
 submitted to the U.S. Department of               
 Transportation by PPG Industries of               
 Monroeville, Pennsylvania indicates that          
 regulations do not require competing railroads    
 to cooperate with one another to find             
 alternative routes available that can lower       
 terrorism risk for chlorine shipments but that    
 these rules allow railroads to refuse cooperating 
 with each other to use alternative routes which   
 can result in unnecessarily placing shipments     
 onto routes hundreds of miles longer and          
 through major target urban areas because of       
 competition with one another; and                 
       WHEREAS, immediately after the 9/11         
 attacks chlorine and other ultrahazardous         
 railcars were promptly ordered off the tracks     
 and brought to "safe havens" and since this       
 date, according to authors and advocates on       
 this subject, the US Surface Transportation       
 Board filings indicate that federal agencies have 
 been quietly meeting with railroads and           
 shippers to try, with little success, to shorten  
 chlorine and other ultrahazardous cargo routes    
 to reduce terrorism risks; and                    
       WHEREAS, in recent years, chemical          
 releases from railcars in major cities have       
 forced the evacuation of thousands of residents   
 for days at a time, costing the cities hundreds   
 of thousands of dollars during the emergency      
 and resulting in settlements that individually    
 cost the cities and/or railroads millions of      
 dollars to reimburse residents and businesses     
 harmed by the releases; and                       
      WHEREAS, in January 2005 the                 
 derailment of a Norfolk Southern railcar in       
 Graniteville, South Carolina released at least    
 90 tons of chlorine gas resulting in nine deaths, 
 250 injuries and the evacuation of 5400           
 residents for nearly two weeks; and               
      WHEREAS, a "Midnight Regulation"             
finalized by the Bush Administration's              
Federal Railroad Administration, effective          
December 26, 2008, provides that throughout         
2009 each individual railroad can unilaterally      
analyze and select its urban hazardous cargo        
routes with no significant input from state         
and local officials, despite protests from some     
cities and the National Conference of State         
Legislatures for being cut out of major public      
safety decision making process; and                 
       WHEREAS, the new rules require only          
that railroads "consider" using competitors'        
rail lines not that they actually interchange       
cargoes to bypass target areas, nor that railroads  
allow other carriers to use their tracks, nor       
that they consider allowing another carrier         
access to their customers despite requests          
from shippers, state and local governments as       
illustrated in comments of PPG Industries           
submitted to Congress in 2008; and                  
     WHEREAS, local and state governments           
have a direct interest in protecting their          
communities from the threat of hazardous            
materials releases.                                 
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
RESOLVED that the St. Louis Board of                
Aldermen expresses its concern to the               
unnecessary rail transport of potentially toxic     
chlorine, anhydrous ammonia and other               
ultrahazardous cargoes through the City of          
St. Louis and that this Board urges Congress        
and the Obama Administration to revise the          
routing law and the routing rule to include         
requirements that railroads work together with      
mandated inputs from state and local officials      
to determine the safest and most secure routes      
for these cargoes that involve all carriers.        
      Be It Further Resolved that this Board        
of Aldermen urges the Chief of the City of St.      
Louis Fire Department and the Director of           
Public Safety to contact the railroads operating    
through the City of St. Louis and request           
participation in their routing analyses, route      
selections and planning that impact our             
citizens and to assess the adequacy of the          
transportation security vulnerability               
assessments and security plans produced by          
the railroads for routing and storage of            
hazardous shipments that place our citizens         
at risk throughout the area and that a copy of      
this resolution be spread upon the minutes of       
this Board and that a copy be sent to those         
deemed appropriate by its sponsor.                  
Introduced on the 30th day of April, 2010 by:       
HonorableTerry Kennedy,Alderman 18th Ward           
     Mr. Kennedy moved that Resolution No.

Safety.                                             
     Seconded by Mr. Williamson.                    
      Carried unanimously by voice vote.            
       Mr. Boyd moved to suspend the rules

 53.                                                
      Seconded by Mr. Williamson.

      Present: 0                                    
      Mr. Kennedy introduced Resolution             
 No. 53 and the Clerk was instructed to read        
 same.                                              
            Resolution No. 53                       
     WHEREAS, over a number of years,               
 Missouri has developed a variety of creative       
 tax credit programs that have grown                
 Missouri's economy and the economies of            
 Missouri's cities and towns and revitalized        
 many distressed areas in our great state; and      
       WHEREAS, these tax credits also              
 produce permanent jobs-in stores, restaurants,     
 offices and hotels: in the three years 2005        
 through 2007 and in the City of St. Louis          
 alone, developments made possible with             
 Missouri's historic tax credit created an average  
 of nearly 800 jobs per year-a total of slightly    
 more than 2,300 permanent jobs that will           
 remain in Missouri and keep our citizens           
 employed, year after year; and                     
       WHEREAS, residents of residential tax        
 credit developments provide customers that         
 grow new retail that in turn attracts new          
 residents who are seeking a variety of diversity   
 and sustainability in their lifestyles and         
 enhance our attractiveness as a convention,        
 business travel, and leisure travel destination;   
 and                                                
       WHEREAS, developments made                   
 possible with Missouri's redevelopment tax         
 credits enhance the St. Louis region's             
 convention and tourism industry-an industry        
 that employs more than 10,000 workers-by           
 making the environment around our                  
 convention center safe and attractive:             
 Missouri's tax credits have made it possible       
 to address eyesores in downtown St. Louis          
 that previously detracted from the City's          
 desirability as a tourism and business travel      
 destination, and the retail stores and             
 restaurants that now occupy the first floors       
 of many of downtown's buildings also produce       
 Missouri sales tax revenue and enhance             
 Missouri's destination potential, and thanks       
 to these efforts, in late January, St. Louis was 
 named by the National Trust for Historic         
 Preservation as one of America's Distinctive     
 Destinations: "These places have masterfully     
 transformed colorful pasts and sustainable       
 futures into the ultimate tourism experiences,"  
 said the National Trust; and                     
       WHEREAS, addressing vacant and             
 abandoned eyesores also enhances the City's      
 and the region's attractiveness as a place for   
 new development: nearly 90% of the               
 rehabilitation developments using historic tax   
 credits and many of the Brownfields              
 development sites were vacant eyesores for a     
 long time before rehabilitation, inhibiting      
 investment in these distressed areas, and as     
 these eyesores are eliminated with historic      
 rehabilitation and Brownfields cleanup, they     
 also create a unique environment that celebrates 
 Missouri's history and attracts people who       
 value diversity-in architecture, in our cultures,
 and in our people; and                           
      WHEREAS, we have made great                 
 progress-but a lot of historic buildings,        
 Brownfields sites and other problems still need  
 to be addressed, both downtown and in our        
 neighborhoods, and                               
 we still have a large supply of vacant historic  
 buildings in need of rehabilitation, Brownfields 
 sites in need of cleanup, and vacant sites that  
 are redevelopment opportunities; and             
       WHEREAS, the asset that differentiates     
 city neighborhoods and gives them market         
 potential is their stock of unique buildings-    
 but many of these neighborhoods have long        
 suffered from disinvestment and                  
 abandonment, and they need incentives to         
 induce residents and businesses to invest;       
 historic credits, Brownfields credits and credit 
 programs offered by the Missouri                 
 Development Finance Board offer                  
 opportunities for our distressed                 
 neighborhoods, downtown and in other parts       
 of the city, to fulfull their potential as       
 contributors to Missouri's economy; and          
       WHEREAS, due to the recession, both        
 applications for and redemption of historic      
 tax credits have significantly decreased-and     
 large developments that are approved for tax     
 credits now will not redeem their credits for    
 several years: development takes time, and,      
 after development is completed, compiling the    
 documentation that is necessary for the state    
 to issue tax credit approvals takes more time,   
 and it will be a minimum of two years before     
 developments that are approved today result      
 in any cost to the state-thus, cutting off tax   
 credit approvals now will not help the state's   
 current budget problem; and                      
      WHEREAS, we acknowledge that                
Missouri's tax credit programs can use some           
improvement, but the necessary                        
improvements should be made in a thoughtful           
way, in consultation with the industries that         
use them-not with in a rush with only a few           
weeks to go in the legislative session, and not       
with an emergency clause that makes these             
drastic changes effective less than three months      
from now; and                                         
      WHEREAS, the City of St. Louis wants            
to work with the Missouri legislature, the            
department of economic development and                
these industries over the summer to develop a         
tax credit reform proposal that makes sense,          
that can be supported by the affected                 
industries, and that will grow Missouri's             
economy rather than stifle it.                        
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT                             
RESOLVED that the Board of Aldermen of                
the City of St. Louis urges the Missouri              
legislature to avoid acting in haste on the issue     
of Missouri's tax credits, as such hasty action       
will destroy Missouri industries that rely on         
Missouri's redevelopment tax credits and              
threaten the revitalization of distressed             
neighborhoods in Missouri, and urges the              
legislature to work with the City of St. Louis        
and others involved in these industries and           
the revitalization of Missouri's neighborhoods        
on a tax credit reform proposal that protects         
the benefits of these tax credits for Missouri's      
economy.

 in the business, prior performance and the bid   
 submitted in relation to the needs of the St.    
 Louis Metropolitan Police Department.            
       Bidders are hereby advised that the St.    
 Louis Living Wage Ordinance #65597 and

 exemptions apply, all individuals who perform    
 work pursuant to a contract executed between     
 the successful bidder and the City must be       
 paid a minimum of the applicable Living Wage     
 rates and if rates are adjusted during the term  
 of the contract pursuant to the Ordinance,       
 applicable rates after such adjustment is made.  
 Each bidder must submit the "Living Wage         
 Acknowledgment and Acceptance Declaration        
 with the bid. Failure to submit this Declaration 
 with the bid will result in rejection of the bid.

 the contract provisions related to the Living    
 Wage Ordinance may result in termination of      
 the contract and the imposition of additional    
 penalties as set for in the Ordinance and        
 Regulations.

 works projects to be paid prevailing wages.      
 The contractor will forfeit a penalty to the     
 contracting public body of $100 per day (or      
 portion of a day) if a worker is paid less than  
 the prevailing rate for any work done under      
 the contract by the contractor or by any
