       WHEREAS, the beloved Jack Buck,

       AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED

 Introduced on the 30th day of May, 2003 by:       
 Honorable Joseph Vollmer, Alderman 10th Ward      
            Resolution No. 68                      
      WHEREAS , we have been apprised that         
 Irv Logan, Community Specialist, Missouri         
 Department of Conservation, is retiring after     
 a 22 year distinguished career of exemplary       
 public service; and                               
       WHEREAS , Irv has served the citizens       
 of St. Louis in many varied and distinguished     
 ways including serving as the State of            
 Missouri*s primary conservation advisor on        
 the task force that designed the Forest Park      
 Master Plan; and                                  
       WHEREAS, the State of Missouri,             
 under Irv* s able guidance, has spent several     
 million dollars on major capital improvements     
 to City of St. Louis, including lake renovations  
 in fourteen City Parks, infrastructure            
 rehabilitation, construction of facilities,       
 funding of community based programs; and          
       WHEREAS ,          Irv    championed        
 Conservation Department funding of the St.        
 Louis Riverfront Trail with nearly a million      
 dollars worth of capital improvements. This       
 trail system now known as the Confluence          
 Greenway Project is being developed on both       
 sides of the Mississippi River and has proven     
 to be of enormous recreational benefit to         
 regional citizens; and                            
       WHEREAS, Try worked tirelessly              
 engineering agreement between all parties for     
 the sale of Columbia Bottom to the State of       
 Missouri by the City for the benefit of all the   
 regions citizens. This agreement worth            
 approximately 10 million dollars to the city      
 has created enormous potential tourism          
 revenue for our great city. Tourism aside,      
 private sector investment in the area of        
 Columbia Bottom is already generating           
 additional income for the city; and             
        WHEREAS , Irv is one of the co-          
 founders of the Gateway to Gardening            
 Organization now part of the Education          
 division of the Missouri Botanical Garden and   
 renamed Gateway Greening. Gateway               
 Greening has now grown to include               
 community gardens in almost every St. Louis     
 neighborhood. The quality of life has improved  
 in every city neighborhood. Property values     
 in all neighborhoods with community gardens     
 have risen;                                     
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                       
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of            
 the City of St. Louis that we pause in our      
 deliberations to congratulate Irv Logan for 22  
 years of service to the citizens of the City of 
 St. Louis and the State of Missouri and we      
 wish him peace and happiness in his retirement  
 and we direct the Clerk of this Board to spread 
 a copy of this Resolution across the minutes    
 of these proceedings and to further prepare a   
 commemorative copy to the end that it may       
 be presented to our honoree at a time and       
 place deemed appropriate by the Sponsor.
