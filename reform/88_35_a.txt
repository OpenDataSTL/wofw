           Resolution No. 195                     
      WHEREAS, the enactment of Ordinance         
 56054 in 1971 approved the adopted of the        
 provisions of the Municipal Land Reutilization   
 Law, as codified in Section 92.700 et. seq.      
 RSMo., as the City's procedure for the           
 collection of delinquent property taxes; and

 to the property of the new owner and to the       
 entire community; and                             
      WHEREAS, the current LRA

 develop appropriate procedures designed to        
 quickly return these properties to the tax rolls; 
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT
