heard concerning their views on the design of       
the Replacement of the Kingshighway                 
Viaduct with reference to the economic and          
social effects of such design, its impact of the    
environment, and its consistency with the           
goals and objectives of the community.              
     The presently contemplated improve-            
ment is as follows:                                 
      Present viaduct will be demolished and

the outsides. New roadway will be 90 feet           
wide within existing 100 foot right-of-way,         
and the existing side roads leading down to         
Daggett Avenue and to the UPRR tracks will          
be eliminated. Much of the open space               
currently under the roadway will be filled in.      
Shaw Blvd., east of Kingshighway, will be re-       
configured to the south and a south-bound           
turn lane will be added in Kingshighway to          
allow left turns onto east-bound Shaw.              
Aesthetically designed features consistent          
with the adjoining neighborhoods will be            
incorporated into the bridge railings and lighting  
fixtures.
