        WHEREAS, in most cases the loss of           
 power was caused by damage to electrical            
 wires and transformers from falling trees and       
 tree limbs which were located too close to the      
 utility right of way; and                           
      WHEREAS, in many instances the trees           
 causing the damage were very old and their          
 presence pre-dated the electrical wires and         
 poles; and                                          
      WHEREAS, there is clearly the need for         
 a comprehensive, city-wide plan for the             
 pruning, planting, replanting, removal or           
 disposition of trees in parks, along streets,       
 and in other public areas where such trees          
 may impact public safety and welfare; and           
      WHEREAS, this plan needs to be                 
 developed with significant input from a variety     
 of interested parties including the Street          
 Department, Refuse Department, Public               
 Safety Department, AmerenUE and citizens;           
 and                                                 
       WHEREAS, it is within the legislative         
 purview of this Board to act in the best            
 interests of the citizens of this City and to       
 investigate, develop and enact such a plan;         
       NOW THEREFORE BE IT                           
 RESOLVED by the Board of Aldermen of                
 the City of St. Louis that we direct and

 the development and implementation of a city        
 wide plan for the pruning, planting, replanting,    
 removal or disposition of trees in parks, along     
 streets, and in other public areas where such       
 trees may impact public safety and welfare          
 and to the end that this committee is directed      
 to recommend legislative initiatives to             
 implement their findings such committee is          
 authorized to issue subpoenas for the purpose       
 of compelling testimony and the production

 further directed to provide a report of their
